| **[A Gentle Introduction to Conformal Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13608v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conformal prediction is a powerful post-hoc framework for uncertainty quantification that provides distribution-free coverage guarantees. However, these guarantees crucially rely on the assumption of exchangeability. This assumption is fundamentally violated in time series data, where temporal dependence and distributional shifts are pervasive. As a result, classical split-conformal methods may yield prediction intervals that fail to maintain nominal validity. This review unifies recent advances in conformal forecasting methods specifically designed to address nonexchangeable data. We first present a theoretical foundation, deriving finite-sample guarantees for split-conformal prediction under mild weak-dependence conditions. We then survey and classify state-of-the-art approaches that mitigate serial dependence by reweighting calibration data, dynamically updating residual distributions, or adaptively tuning target coverage levels in real time. Finally, we present a comprehensive simulation study that compares these techniques in terms of empirical coverage, interval width, and computational cost, highlighting practical trade-offs and open research directions.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the emergence of numerical instabilities in Next Generation Reservoir Computing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00846v2)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Next Generation Reservoir Computing (NGRC) is a low-cost machine learning method for forecasting chaotic time series from data. Computational efficiency is crucial for scalable reservoir computing, requiring better strategies to reduce training cost. In this work, we uncover a connection between the numerical conditioning of the NGRC feature matrix -- formed by polynomial evaluations on time-delay coordinates -- and the long-term NGRC dynamics. We show that NGRC can be trained without regularization, reducing computational time. Our contributions are twofold. First, merging tools from numerical linear algebra and ergodic theory of dynamical systems, we systematically study how the feature matrix conditioning varies across hyperparameters. We demonstrate that the NGRC feature matrix tends to be ill-conditioned for short time lags, high-degree polynomials, and short length of training data. Second, we evaluate the impact of different numerical algorithms (Cholesky, singular value decomposition (SVD), and lower-upper (LU) decomposition) for solving the regularized least-squares problem. Our results reveal that SVD-based training achieves accurate forecasts without regularization, being preferable when compared against the other algorithms.</p></details> | 23 pages, 14 figures |
| **[Naga: Vedic Encoding for Deep State Space Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13510v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents Naga, a deep State Space Model (SSM) encoding approach inspired by structural concepts from Vedic mathematics. The proposed method introduces a bidirectional representation for time series by jointly processing forward and time-reversed input sequences. These representations are then combined through an element-wise (Hadamard) interaction, resulting in a Vedic-inspired encoding that enhances the model's ability to capture temporal dependencies across distant time steps. We evaluate Naga on multiple long-term time series forecasting (LTSF) benchmarks, including ETTh1, ETTh2, ETTm1, ETTm2, Weather, Traffic, and ILI. The experimental results show that Naga outperforms 28 current state of the art models and demonstrates improved efficiency compared to existing deep SSM-based approaches. The findings suggest that incorporating structured, Vedic-inspired decomposition can provide an interpretable and computationally efficient alternative for long-range sequence modeling.</p></details> | submitted to JMLR |
| **[NeuralOM: Neural Ocean Model for Subseasonal-to-Seasonal Simulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21020v4)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long-term, high-fidelity simulation of slow-changing physical systems, such as the ocean and climate, presents a fundamental challenge in scientific computing. Traditional autoregressive machine learning models often fail in these tasks as minor errors accumulate and lead to rapid forecast degradation. To address this problem, we propose NeuralOM, a general neural operator framework designed for simulating complex, slow-changing dynamics. NeuralOM's core consists of two key innovations: (1) a Progressive Residual Correction Framework that decomposes the forecasting task into a series of fine-grained refinement steps, effectively suppressing long-term error accumulation; and (2) a Physics-Guided Graph Network whose built-in adaptive messaging mechanism explicitly models multi-scale physical interactions, such as gradient-driven flows and multiplicative couplings, thereby enhancing physical consistency while maintaining computational efficiency. We validate NeuralOM on the challenging task of global Subseasonal-to-Seasonal (S2S) ocean simulation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NeuralOM not only surpasses state-of-the-art models in forecast accuracy and long-term stability, but also excels in simulating extreme events. For instance, at a 60-day lead time, NeuralOM achieves a 13.3% lower RMSE compared to the best-performing baseline, offering a stable, efficient, and physically-aware paradigm for data-driven scientific computing.

| **[MMWSTM-ADRAN+: A Novel Hybrid Deep Learning Architecture for Enhanced Climate Time Series Forecasting and Extreme Event Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13419v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate short-range prediction of extreme air temperature events remains a fundamental challenge in operational climate-risk management. We present Multi-Modal Weather State Transition Model with Anomaly-Driven Recurrent Attention Network Plus (MMWSTM-ADRAN+), a dual-stream deep learning architecture that couples a regime-aware dynamics model with an anomaly-focused attention mechanism to forecast daily maximum temperature and its extremes. The first stream, MMWSTM, combines bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) units with a learnable Markov state transition matrix to capture synoptic-scale weather regime changes. The second stream, ADRAN, integrates bidirectional Gated Recurrent Units (BiGRUs), multi-head self-attention, and a novel anomaly amplification layer to enhance sensitivity to low-probability signals. A lightweight attentive fusion gate adaptively determines the contribution of each stream to the final prediction. Model optimization employs a custom ExtremeWeatherLoss function that up-weights errors on the upper 5% and lower 5% of the temperature distribution, and a time-series data augmentation suite (jittering, scaling, time/magnitude warping) that effectively quadruples the training data</p></details> |  |
| **[Why Cannot Neural Networks Master Extrapolation? Insights from Physical Laws](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04102v2)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motivated by the remarkable success of Foundation Models (FMs) in language modeling, there has been growing interest in developing FMs for time series prediction, given the transformative power such models hold for science and engineering. This culminated in significant success of FMs in short-range forecasting settings. However, extrapolation or long-range forecasting remains elusive for FMs, which struggle to outperform even simple baselines. This contrasts with physical laws which have strong extrapolation properties, and raises the question of the fundamental difference between the structure of neural networks and physical laws. In this work, we identify and formalize a fundamental property characterizing the ability of statistical learning models to predict more accurately outside of their training domain, hence explaining performance deterioration for deep learning models in extrapolation settings. In addition to a theoretical analysis, we present empirical results showcasing the implications of this property on current deep learning architectures. Our results not only clarify the root causes of the extrapolation gap but also suggest directions for designing next-generation forecasting models capable of mastering extrapolation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rethinking Irregular Time Series Forecasting: A Simple yet Effective Baseline](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11250v4)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The forecasting of irregular multivariate time series (IMTS) is crucial in key areas such as healthcare, biomechanics, climate science, and astronomy. However, achieving accurate and practical predictions is challenging due to two main factors. First, the inherent irregularity and data missingness in irregular time series make modeling difficult. Second, most existing methods are typically complex and resource-intensive. In this study, we propose a general framework called APN to address these challenges. Specifically, we design a novel Time-Aware Patch Aggregation (TAPA) module that achieves adaptive patching. By learning dynamically adjustable patch boundaries and a time-aware weighted averaging strategy, TAPA transforms the original irregular sequences into high-quality, regularized representations in a channel-independent manner. Additionally, we use a simple query module to effectively integrate historical information while maintaining the model's efficiency. Finally, predictions are made by a shallow MLP. Experimental results on multiple real-world datasets show that APN outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in both efficiency and accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Non-Stationary Time Series Forecasting with Temporal Stabilization and Frequency Differencing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08229v5)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting is critical for decision-making across dynamic domains such as energy, finance, transportation, and cloud computing. However, real-world time series often exhibit non-stationarity, including temporal distribution shifts and spectral variability, which pose significant challenges for long-term time series forecasting. In this paper, we propose DTAF, a dual-branch framework that addresses non-stationarity in both the temporal and frequency domains. For the temporal domain, the Temporal Stabilizing Fusion (TFS) module employs a non-stationary mix of experts (MOE) filter to disentangle and suppress temporal non-stationary patterns while preserving long-term dependencies. For the frequency domain, the Frequency Wave Modeling (FWM) module applies frequency differencing to dynamically highlight components with significant spectral shifts. By fusing the complementary outputs of TFS and FWM, DTAF generates robust forecasts that adapt to both temporal and frequency domain non-stationarity. Extensive experiments on real-world benchmarks demonstrate that DTAF outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, yielding significant improvements in forecasting accuracy under non-stationary conditions.

| **[A FEDformer-Based Hybrid Framework for Anomaly Detection and Risk Forecasting in Financial Time Series](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12951v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Financial markets are inherently volatile and prone to sudden disruptions such as market crashes, flash collapses, and liquidity crises. Accurate anomaly detection and early risk forecasting in financial time series are therefore crucial for preventing systemic instability and supporting informed investment decisions. Traditional deep learning models, such as LSTM and GRU, often fail to capture long-term dependencies and complex periodic patterns in highly nonstationary financial data. To address this limitation, this study proposes a FEDformer-Based Hybrid Framework for Anomaly Detection and Risk Forecasting in Financial Time Series, which integrates the Frequency Enhanced Decomposed Transformer (FEDformer) with a residual-based anomaly detector and a risk forecasting head. The FEDformer module models temporal dynamics in both time and frequency domains, decomposing signals into trend and seasonal components for improved interpretability. The residual-based detector identifies abnormal fluctuations by analyzing prediction errors, while the risk head predicts potential financial distress using learned latent embeddings. Experiments conducted on the S&P 500, NASDAQ Composite, and Brent Crude Oil datasets (2000-2024) demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model over benchmark methods, achieving a 15.7 percent reduction in RMSE and an 11.5 percent improvement in F1-score for anomaly detection. These results confirm the effectiveness of the model in capturing financial volatility, enabling reliable early-warning systems for market crash prediction and risk management.</p></details> |  |
| **[APT: Affine Prototype-Timestamp For Time Series Forecasting Under Distribution Shift](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12945v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting under distribution shift remains challenging, as existing deep learning models often rely on local statistical normalization (e.g., mean and variance) that fails to capture global distribution shift. Methods like RevIN and its variants attempt to decouple distribution and pattern but still struggle with missing values, noisy observations, and invalid channel-wise affine transformation. To address these limitations, we propose Affine Prototype Timestamp (APT), a lightweight and flexible plug-in module that injects global distribution features into the normalization-forecasting pipeline. By leveraging timestamp conditioned prototype learning, APT dynamically generates affine parameters that modulate both input and output series, enabling the backbone to learn from self-supervised, distribution-aware clustered instances. APT is compatible with arbitrary forecasting backbones and normalization strategies while introducing minimal computational overhead. Extensive experiments across six benchmark datasets and multiple backbone-normalization combinations demonstrate that APT significantly improves forecasting performance under distribution shift.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Simple and Effective Random Forest Modelling for Nonlinear Time Series Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06544v2)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose Random Forests by Random Weights (RF-RW), a theoretically grounded and practically effective alternative RF modelling for nonlinear time series data, where existing RF-based approaches struggle to adequately capture temporal dependence. RF-RW reconciles the strengths of classic RF with the temporal dependence inherent in time series forecasting. Specifically, it avoids the bootstrap resampling procedure, therefore preserves the serial dependence structure, whilst incorporates independent random weights to reduce correlations among trees. We establish non-asymptotic concentration bounds and asymptotic uniform consistency guarantees, for both fixed- and high-dimensional feature spaces, which extend beyond existing theoretical analyses of RF. Extensive simulation studies demonstrate that RF-RW outperforms existing RF-based approaches and other benchmarks such as SVM and LSTM. It also achieves the lowest error among competitors in our real-data example of predicting UK COVID-19 daily cases.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimal Look-back Horizon for Time Series Forecasting in Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12791v1)** | 2025-11-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Selecting an appropriate look-back horizon remains a fundamental challenge in time series forecasting (TSF), particularly in the federated learning scenarios where data is decentralized, heterogeneous, and often non-independent. While recent work has explored horizon selection by preserving forecasting-relevant information in an intrinsic space, these approaches are primarily restricted to centralized and independently distributed settings. This paper presents a principled framework for adaptive horizon selection in federated time series forecasting through an intrinsic space formulation. We introduce a synthetic data generator (SDG) that captures essential temporal structures in client data, including autoregressive dependencies, seasonality, and trend, while incorporating client-specific heterogeneity. Building on this model, we define a transformation that maps time series windows into an intrinsic representation space with well-defined geometric and statistical properties. We then derive a decomposition of the forecasting loss into a Bayesian term, which reflects irreducible uncertainty, and an approximation term, which accounts for finite-sample effects and limited model capacity. Our analysis shows that while increasing the look-back horizon improves the identifiability of deterministic patterns, it also increases approximation error due to higher model complexity and reduced sample efficiency. We prove that the total forecasting loss is minimized at the smallest horizon where the irreducible loss starts to saturate, while the approximation loss continues to rise. This work provides a rigorous theoretical foundation for adaptive horizon selection for time series forecasting in federated learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI-26 as Oral Presentation</p></details> |
| **[MIRA: Medical Time Series Foundation Model for Real-World Health Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07584v6)** | 2025-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A unified foundation model for medical time series -- pretrained on open access and ethics board-approved medical corpora -- offers the potential to reduce annotation burdens, minimize model customization, and enable robust transfer across clinical institutions, modalities, and tasks, particularly in data-scarce or privacy-constrained environments. However, existing generalist time series foundation models struggle to handle medical time series data due to their inherent challenges, including irregular intervals, heterogeneous sampling rates, and frequent missing values. To address these challenges, we introduce MIRA, a unified foundation model specifically designed for medical time series forecasting. MIRA incorporates a Continuous-Time Rotary Positional Encoding that enables fine-grained modeling of variable time intervals, a frequency-specific mixture-of-experts layer that routes computation across latent frequency regimes to further promote temporal specialization, and a Continuous Dynamics Extrapolation Block based on Neural ODE that models the continuous trajectory of latent states, enabling accurate forecasting at arbitrary target timestamps. Pretrained on a large-scale and diverse medical corpus comprising over 454 billion time points collect from publicly available datasets, MIRA achieves reductions in forecasting errors by an average of 10% and 7% in out-of-distribution and in-distribution scenarios, respectively, when compared to other zero-shot and fine-tuned baselines. We also introduce a comprehensive benchmark spanning multiple downstream clinical tasks, establishing a foundation for future research in medical time series modeling.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025 Main Conference</p></details> |
| **[Beyond Observations: Reconstruction Error-Guided Irregularly Sampled Time Series Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06854v2)** | 2025-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Irregularly sampled time series (ISTS), characterized by non-uniform time intervals with natural missingness, are prevalent in real-world applications. Existing approaches for ISTS modeling primarily rely on observed values to impute unobserved ones or infer latent dynamics. However, these methods overlook a critical source of learning signal: the reconstruction error inherently produced during model training. Such error implicitly reflects how well a model captures the underlying data structure and can serve as an informative proxy for unobserved values. To exploit this insight, we propose iTimER, a simple yet effective self-supervised pre-training framework for ISTS representation learning. iTimER models the distribution of reconstruction errors over observed values and generates pseudo-observations for unobserved timestamps through a mixup strategy between sampled errors and the last available observations. This transforms unobserved timestamps into noise-aware training targets, enabling meaningful reconstruction signals. A Wasserstein metric aligns reconstruction error distributions between observed and pseudo-observed regions, while a contrastive learning objective enhances the discriminability of learned representations. Extensive experiments on classification, interpolation, and forecasting tasks demonstrate that iTimER consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods under the ISTS setting.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026</p></details> |
| **[PAX-TS: Model-agnostic multi-granular explanations for time series forecasting via localized perturbations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18982v2)** | 2025-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting has seen considerable improvement during the last years, with transformer models and large language models driving advancements of the state of the art. Modern forecasting models are generally opaque and do not provide explanations for their forecasts, while well-known post-hoc explainability methods like LIME are not suitable for the forecasting context. We propose PAX-TS, a model-agnostic post-hoc algorithm to explain time series forecasting models and their forecasts. Our method is based on localized input perturbations and results in multi-granular explanations. Further, it is able to characterize cross-channel correlations for multivariate time series forecasts. We clearly outline the algorithmic procedure behind PAX-TS, demonstrate it on a benchmark with 7 algorithms and 10 diverse datasets, compare it with two other state-of-the-art explanation algorithms, and present the different explanation types of the method. We found that the explanations of high-performing and low-performing algorithms differ on the same datasets, highlighting that the explanations of PAX-TS effectively capture a model's behavior. Based on time step correlation matrices resulting from the benchmark, we identify 6 classes of patterns that repeatedly occur across different datasets and algorithms. We found that the patterns are indicators of performance, with noticeable differences in forecasting error between the classes. Lastly, we outline a multivariate example where PAX-TS demonstrates how the forecasting model takes cross-channel correlations into account. With PAX-TS, time series forecasting models' mechanisms can be illustrated in different levels of detail, and its explanations can be used to answer practical questions on forecasts.</p></details> |  |
| **[DeepMIDE: A Multi-Output Spatio-Temporal Method for Ultra-Scale Offshore Wind Energy Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20166v2)** | 2025-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To unlock access to stronger winds, the offshore wind industry is advancing towards significantly larger and taller wind turbines. This massive upscaling motivates a departure from wind forecasting methods that traditionally focused on a single representative height. To fill this gap, we propose DeepMIDE--a statistical deep learning method which jointly models the offshore wind speeds across space, time, and height. DeepMIDE is formulated as a multi-output integro-difference equation model with a multivariate nonstationary kernel characterized by a set of advection vectors that encode the physics of wind field formation and propagation. Embedded within DeepMIDE, an advanced deep learning architecture learns these advection vectors from high-dimensional streams of exogenous weather information, which, along with other parameters, are plugged back into the statistical model for probabilistic multi-height space-time forecasting. Tested on real-world data from offshore wind energy areas in the Northeastern United States, the wind speed and power forecasts from DeepMIDE are shown to outperform those from prevalent time series, spatio-temporal, and deep learning methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[ReCast: Reliability-aware Codebook Assisted Lightweight Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11991v1)** | 2025-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting is crucial for applications in various domains. Conventional methods often rely on global decomposition into trend, seasonal, and residual components, which become ineffective for real-world series dominated by local, complex, and highly dynamic patterns. Moreover, the high model complexity of such approaches limits their applicability in real-time or resource-constrained environments. In this work, we propose a novel \textbf{RE}liability-aware \textbf{C}odebook-\textbf{AS}sisted \textbf{T}ime series forecasting framework (\textbf{ReCast}) that enables lightweight and robust prediction by exploiting recurring local shapes. ReCast encodes local patterns into discrete embeddings through patch-wise quantization using a learnable codebook, thereby compactly capturing stable regular structures. To compensate for residual variations not preserved by quantization, ReCast employs a dual-path architecture comprising a quantization path for efficient modeling of regular structures and a residual path for reconstructing irregular fluctuations. A central contribution of ReCast is a reliability-aware codebook update strategy, which incrementally refines the codebook via weighted corrections. These correction weights are derived by fusing multiple reliability factors from complementary perspectives by a distributionally robust optimization (DRO) scheme, ensuring adaptability to non-stationarity and robustness to distribution shifts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ReCast outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) models in accuracy, efficiency, and adaptability to distribution shifts.</p></details> | AAAI 2026 Oral |
| **[Echo Flow Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24122v2)** | 2025-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>At the heart of time-series forecasting (TSF) lies a fundamental challenge: how can models efficiently and effectively capture long-range temporal dependencies across ever-growing sequences? While deep learning has brought notable progress, conventional architectures often face a trade-off between computational complexity and their ability to retain accumulative information over extended horizons. Echo State Networks (ESNs), a class of reservoir computing models, have recently regained attention for their exceptional efficiency, offering constant memory usage and per-step training complexity regardless of input length. This makes them particularly attractive for modeling extremely long-term event history in TSF. However, traditional ESNs fall short of state-of-the-art performance due to their limited nonlinear capacity, which constrains both their expressiveness and stability. We introduce Echo Flow Networks (EFNs), a framework composed of a group of extended Echo State Networks (X-ESNs) with MLP readouts, enhanced by our novel Matrix-Gated Composite Random Activation (MCRA), which enables complex, neuron-specific temporal dynamics, significantly expanding the network's representational capacity without compromising computational efficiency. In addition, we propose a dual-stream architecture in which recent input history dynamically selects signature reservoir features from an infinite-horizon memory, leading to improved prediction accuracy and long-term stability. Extensive evaluations on five benchmarks demonstrate that EFNs achieve up to 4x faster training and 3x smaller model size compared to leading methods like PatchTST, reducing forecasting error from 43% to 35%, a 20% relative improvement. One instantiation of our framework, EchoFormer, consistently achieves new state-of-the-art performance across five benchmark datasets: ETTh, ETTm, DMV, Weather, and Air Quality.</p></details> | Under Review |
| **[Leveraging Exogenous Signals for Hydrology Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11849v1)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in time series research facilitate the development of foundation models. While many state-of-the-art time series foundation models have been introduced, few studies examine their effectiveness in specific downstream applications in physical science. This work investigates the role of integrating domain knowledge into time series models for hydrological rainfall-runoff modeling. Using the CAMELS-US dataset, which includes rainfall and runoff data from 671 locations with six time series streams and 30 static features, we compare baseline and foundation models. Results demonstrate that models incorporating comprehensive known exogenous inputs outperform more limited approaches, including foundation models. Notably, incorporating natural annual periodic time series contribute the most significant improvements.</p></details> |  |
| **[FreDN: Spectral Disentanglement for Time Series Forecasting via Learnable Frequency Decomposition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11817v1)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting is essential in a wide range of real world applications. Recently, frequency-domain methods have attracted increasing interest for their ability to capture global dependencies. However, when applied to non-stationary time series, these methods encounter the $\textit{spectral entanglement}$ and the computational burden of complex-valued learning. The $\textit{spectral entanglement}$ refers to the overlap of trends, periodicities, and noise across the spectrum due to $\textit{spectral leakage}$ and the presence of non-stationarity. However, existing decompositions are not suited to resolving spectral entanglement. To address this, we propose the Frequency Decomposition Network (FreDN), which introduces a learnable Frequency Disentangler module to separate trend and periodic components directly in the frequency domain. Furthermore, we propose a theoretically supported ReIm Block to reduce the complexity of complex-valued operations while maintaining performance. We also re-examine the frequency-domain loss function and provide new theoretical insights into its effectiveness. Extensive experiments on seven long-term forecasting benchmarks demonstrate that FreDN outperforms state-of-the-art methods by up to 10\%. Furthermore, compared with standard complex-valued architectures, our real-imaginary shared-parameter design reduces the parameter count and computational cost by at least 50\%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Epistemic Error Decomposition for Multi-step Time Series Forecasting: Rethinking Bias-Variance in Recursive and Direct Strategies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11461v1)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-step forecasting is often described through a simple rule of thumb: recursive strategies are said to have high bias and low variance, while direct strategies are said to have low bias and high variance. We revisit this belief by decomposing the expected multi-step forecast error into three parts: irreducible noise, a structural approximation gap, and an estimation-variance term. For linear predictors we show that the structural gap is identically zero for any dataset. For nonlinear predictors, however, the repeated composition used in recursion can increase model expressivity, making the structural gap depend on both the model and the data. We further show that the estimation variance of the recursive strategy at any horizon can be written as the one-step variance multiplied by a Jacobian-based amplification factor that measures how sensitive the composed predictor is to parameter error. This perspective explains when recursive forecasting may simultaneously have lower bias and higher variance than direct forecasting. Experiments with multilayer perceptrons on the ETTm1 dataset confirm these findings. The results offer practical guidance for choosing between recursive and direct strategies based on model nonlinearity and noise characteristics, rather than relying on traditional bias-variance intuition.</p></details> | <details><summary>2025 ...</summary><p>2025 EIML Eurips Workshop, 6 pages</p></details> |
| **[Automated lag-selection for multi-step univariate time series forecast using Bayesian Optimization: Forecast station-wise monthly rainfall of nine divisional cities of Bangladesh](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08070v2)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rainfall is an essential hydrological component, and most of the economic activities of an agrarian country like Bangladesh depend on rainfall. An accurate rainfall forecast can help make necessary decisions and reduce the damages caused by heavy or low to no rainfall. The monthly average rainfall is a time series data, and recently, long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks are being used heavily for time series forecasting problems. One major challenge of forecasting using LSTMs is to select the appropriate number of lag values. In this research, we considered the number of lag values selected as a hyperparameter of LSTM; it, with the other hyperparameters determining LSTMs structure, has been optimized using Bayesian optimization. We used our proposed method to forecast rainfall for nine different weather stations of Bangladesh. Finally, the performance of the proposed model has been compared with some other LSTM with different lag-selection methods and some several popular machine learning and statistical forecasting models.</p></details> |  |
| **[OccamVTS: Distilling Vision Models to 1% Parameters for Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01727v2)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting is fundamental to diverse applications, with recent approaches leverage large vision models (LVMs) to capture temporal patterns through visual representations. We reveal that while vision models enhance forecasting performance, 99% of their parameters are unnecessary for time series tasks. Through cross-modal analysis, we find that time series align with low-level textural features but not high-level semantics, which can impair forecasting accuracy. We propose OccamVTS, a knowledge distillation framework that extracts only the essential 1% of predictive information from LVMs into lightweight networks. Using pre-trained LVMs as privileged teachers, OccamVTS employs pyramid-style feature alignment combined with correlation and feature distillation to transfer beneficial patterns while filtering out semantic noise. Counterintuitively, this aggressive parameter reduction improves accuracy by eliminating overfitting to irrelevant visual features while preserving essential temporal patterns. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that OccamVTS consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance with only 1% of the original parameters, particularly excelling in few-shot and zero-shot scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Each node is a service that emits a multivariate stream of system-level performance metrics, capturing CPU, memory, and network usage patterns, while directed edges encode dependencies between services. The primary task is forecasting future values of these signals at the service level. In addition, ChronoGraph provides expert-annotated incident windows as anomaly labels, enabling evaluation of anomaly detection methods and assessment of forecast robustness during operational disruptions. Compared to existing benchmarks from industrial control systems or traffic and air-quality domains, ChronoGraph uniquely combines (i) multivariate time series, (ii) an explicit, machine-readable dependency graph, and (iii) anomaly labels aligned with real incidents. We report baseline results spanning forecasting models, pretrained time-series foundation models, and standard anomaly detectors. ChronoGraph offers a realistic benchmark for studying structure-aware forecasting and incident-aware evaluation in microservice systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Prediction of linear fractional stable motions using codifference, with application to non-Gaussian rough volatility](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15437v2)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The linear fractional stable motion (LFSM) extends the fractional Brownian motion (fBm) by considering $α$-stable increments. We propose a method to forecast future increments of the LFSM from past discrete-time observations, using the conditional expectation when $α>1$ or a semimetric projection otherwise. It relies on the codifference, which describes the serial dependence of the process, instead of the covariance. Indeed, covariance is commonly used for predicting an fBm but it is infinite when $α<2$. Some theoretical properties of the method and of its accuracy are studied and both a simulation study and an application to real data confirm the relevance of the approach. The LFSM-based method outperforms the fBm, when forecasting high-frequency FX rates. It also shows a promising performance in the forecast of time series of volatilities, decomposing properly, in the fractal dynamic of rough volatilities, the contribution of the kurtosis of the increments and the contribution of their serial dependence. Moreover, the analysis of hit ratios suggests that, beside independence, persistence, and antipersistence, a fourth regime of serial dependence exists for fractional processes, characterized by a selective memory controlled by a few large increments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond MSE: Ordinal Cross-Entropy for Probabilistic Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10200v1)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting is an important task that involves analyzing temporal dependencies and underlying patterns (such as trends, cyclicality, and seasonality) in historical data to predict future values or trends. Current deep learning-based forecasting models primarily employ Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss functions for regression modeling. Despite enabling direct value prediction, this method offers no uncertainty estimation and exhibits poor outlier robustness. To address these limitations, we propose OCE-TS, a novel ordinal classification approach for time series forecasting that replaces MSE with Ordinal Cross-Entropy (OCE) loss, preserving prediction order while quantifying uncertainty through probability output. Specifically, OCE-TS begins by discretizing observed values into ordered intervals and deriving their probabilities via a parametric distribution as supervision signals. Using a simple linear model, we then predict probability distributions for each timestep. The OCE loss is computed between the cumulative distributions of predicted and ground-truth probabilities, explicitly preserving ordinal relationships among forecasted values. Through theoretical analysis using influence functions, we establish that cross-entropy (CE) loss exhibits superior stability and outlier robustness compared to MSE loss. Empirically, we compared OCE-TS with five baseline models-Autoformer, DLinear, iTransformer, TimeXer, and TimeBridge-on seven public time series datasets. Using MSE and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) as evaluation metrics, the results demonstrate that OCE-TS consistently outperforms benchmark models. The code will be published.</p></details> |  |
| **[RI-Loss: A Learnable Residual-Informed Loss for Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10130v1)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting relies on predicting future values from historical data, yet most state-of-the-art approaches-including transformer and multilayer perceptron-based models-optimize using Mean Squared Error (MSE), which has two fundamental weaknesses: its point-wise error computation fails to capture temporal relationships, and it does not account for inherent noise in the data. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the Residual-Informed Loss (RI-Loss), a novel objective function based on the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC). RI-Loss explicitly models noise structure by enforcing dependence between the residual sequence and a random time series, enabling more robust, noise-aware representations. Theoretically, we derive the first non-asymptotic HSIC bound with explicit double-sample complexity terms, achieving optimal convergence rates through Bernstein-type concentration inequalities and Rademacher complexity analysis. This provides rigorous guarantees for RI-Loss optimization while precisely quantifying kernel space interactions. Empirically, experiments across eight real-world benchmarks and five leading forecasting models demonstrate improvements in predictive performance, validating the effectiveness of our approach. Code will be made publicly available to ensure reproducibility.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Time Series Forecasting through Selective Representation Spaces: A Patch Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14510v3)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time Series Forecasting has made significant progress with the help of Patching technique, which partitions time series into multiple patches to effectively retain contextual semantic information into a representation space beneficial for modeling long-term dependencies. However, conventional patching partitions a time series into adjacent patches, which causes a fixed representation space, thus resulting in insufficiently expressful representations. In this paper, we pioneer the exploration of constructing a selective representation space to flexibly include the most informative patches for forecasting. Specifically, we propose the Selective Representation Space (SRS) module, which utilizes the learnable Selective Patching and Dynamic Reassembly techniques to adaptively select and shuffle the patches from the contextual time series, aiming at fully exploiting the information of contextual time series to enhance the forecasting performance of patch-based models. To demonstrate the effectiveness of SRS module, we propose a simple yet effective SRSNet consisting of SRS and an MLP head, which achieves state-of-the-art performance on real-world datasets from multiple domains. Furthermore, as a novel plugin-and-play module, SRS can also enhance the performance of existing patch-based models. The resources are available at https://github.com/decisionintelligence/SRSNet.</p></details> |  |

While MLP-based methods have gained attention for achieving Transformer-comparable performance with fewer parameters and better robustness, they face critical limitations including loss of weak seasonal signals, capacity constraints in weight-sharing MLPs, and insufficient channel fusion in channel-independent strategies. To address these challenges, we propose MDMLP-EIA (Multi-domain Dynamic MLPs with Energy Invariant Attention) with three key innovations. First, we develop an adaptive fused dual-domain seasonal MLP that categorizes seasonal signals into strong and weak components. It employs an adaptive zero-initialized channel fusion strategy to minimize noise interference while effectively integrating predictions. Second, we introduce an energy invariant attention mechanism that adaptively focuses on different feature channels within trend and seasonal predictions across time steps. This mechanism maintains constant total signal energy to align with the decomposition-prediction-reconstruction framework and enhance robustness against disturbances. Third, we propose a dynamic capacity adjustment mechanism for channel-independent MLPs. This mechanism scales neuron count with the square root of channel count, ensuring sufficient capacity as channels increase. Extensive experiments across nine benchmark datasets demonstrate that MDMLP-EIA achieves state-of-the-art performance in both prediction accuracy and computational efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[CaReTS: A Multi-Task Framework Unifying Classification and Regression for Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09789v1)** | 2025-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in deep forecasting models have achieved remarkable performance, yet most approaches still struggle to provide both accurate predictions and interpretable insights into temporal dynamics. This paper proposes CaReTS, a novel multi-task learning framework that combines classification and regression tasks for multi-step time series forecasting problems. The framework adopts a dual-stream architecture, where a classification branch learns the stepwise trend into the future, while a regression branch estimates the corresponding deviations from the latest observation of the target variable. The dual-stream design provides more interpretable predictions by disentangling macro-level trends from micro-level deviations in the target variable. To enable effective learning in output prediction, deviation estimation, and trend classification, we design a multi-task loss with uncertainty-aware weighting to adaptively balance the contribution of each task. Furthermore, four variants (CaReTS1--4) are instantiated under this framework to incorporate mainstream temporal modelling encoders, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs), long short-term memory networks (LSTMs), and Transformers. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that CaReTS outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) algorithms in forecasting accuracy, while achieving higher trend classification performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[xLSTMAD: A Powerful xLSTM-based Method for Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22837v2)** | 2025-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recently proposed xLSTM is a powerful model that leverages expressive multiplicative gating and residual connections, providing the temporal capacity needed for long-horizon forecasting and representation learning. This architecture has demonstrated success in time series forecasting, lossless compression, and even large-scale language modeling tasks, where its linear memory footprint and fast inference make it a viable alternative to Transformers. Despite its growing popularity, no prior work has explored xLSTM for anomaly detection. In this work, we fill this gap by proposing xLSTMAD, the first anomaly detection method that integrates a full encoder-decoder xLSTM architecture, purpose-built for multivariate time series data. Our encoder processes input sequences to capture historical context, while the decoder is devised in two separate variants of the method. In the forecasting approach, the decoder iteratively generates forecasted future values xLSTMAD-F, while the reconstruction approach reconstructs the input time series from its encoded counterpart xLSTMAD-R. We investigate the performance of two loss functions: Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Soft Dynamic Time Warping (SoftDTW) to consider local reconstruction fidelity and global sequence alignment, respectively. We evaluate our method on the comprehensive TSB-AD-M benchmark, which spans 17 real-world datasets, using state-of-the-art challenging metrics such as VUS-PR. In our results, xLSTM showcases state-of-the-art accuracy, outperforming 23 popular anomaly detection baselines. Our paper is the first work revealing the powerful modeling capabilities of xLSTM for anomaly detection, paving the way for exciting new developments on this subject.

| **[Local Interaction Autoregressive Model for High Dimension Time Series Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09542v1)** | 2025-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-dimensional matrix and tensor time series often exhibit local dependency, where each entry interacts mainly with a small neighborhood. Accounting for local interactions in a prediction model can greatly reduce the dimensionality of the parameter space, leading to more efficient inference and more accurate predictions. We propose a Local Interaction Autoregressive (LIAR) framework and study Separable LIAR, a variant with shared row and column components, for high-dimensional matrix/tensor time series forecasting problems. We derive a scalable parameter estimation algorithm via parallel least squares with a BIC-type neighborhood selector. Theoretically, we show consistency of neighborhood selection and derive error bounds for kernel and auto-covariance estimation. Numerical simulations show that the BIC selector recovers the true neighborhood with high success rates, the LIAR achieves small estimation errors, and the forecasts outperform matrix time-series baselines. In real data applications, a Total Electron Content (TEC) case study shows the model can identify localized spatio-temporal propagation and improved prediction as compared with non-local time series prediction models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Discrete Chi-Square Method beats Discrete Fourier Transform and other similar parametric time series analysis methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01540v3)** | 2025-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We compare two time series analysis methods, the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) and our Discrete Chi-square Method (DCM). DCM is designed for detecting signal(-s) superimposed on an unknown trend. The analytical solution for the non-linear DCM model is an ill-posed problem. We present a computational statistical well-posed solution for this problem. The backbone of DCM is the Gauss-Markov theorem that the least squares fit is the best unbiased estimator for linear regression models. DCM can not fail because this simple time series analysis method computes a massive number of linear least squares fits. Hence, the data spacing, even or uneven, is irrelevant. We use the Fisher-test to identify the best DCM model from all alternative tested DCM models. This best model must also pass our Predictivity-test. Our analyses of simulated complex data sets expose the weaknesses of DFT and the efficiency of DCM. The DFT and DCM are frequency-domain parametric methods. There are many other similar parametric methods. Just like DFT, those other methods suffer from their own particular application limitations. The list of those limitations is long. DCM suffers from none of those limitations. The performance of DCM depends only on the data set size and accuracy. DCM is an ideal forecasting method because the data set time span $(ΔT)$ is irrelevant. It does not matter how long $(ΔT)$ and/or complex the data set is because DCM will inevitably detect the signal(-s) and the trend when the data set size $(n)$ and/or accuracy $(σ)$ become adequate.</p></details> | 27 pages, 8 figures |
| **[PATH: A Discrete-sequence Dataset for Evaluating Online Unsupervised Anomaly Detection Approaches for Multivariate Time Series](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13951v6)** | 2025-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Benchmarking anomaly detection approaches for multivariate time series is a challenging task due to a lack of high-quality datasets. Current publicly available datasets are too small, not diverse and feature trivial anomalies, which hinders measurable progress in this research area. We propose a solution: a diverse, extensive, and non-trivial dataset generated via state-of-the-art simulation tools that reflects realistic behaviour of an automotive powertrain, including its multivariate, dynamic and variable-state properties. Additionally, our dataset represents a discrete-sequence problem, which remains unaddressed by previously-proposed solutions in literature. To cater for both unsupervised and semi-supervised anomaly detection settings, as well as time series generation and forecasting, we make different versions of the dataset available, where training and test subsets are offered in contaminated and clean versions, depending on the task. We also provide baseline results from a selection of approaches based on deterministic and variational autoencoders, as well as a non-parametric approach. As expected, the baseline experimentation shows that the approaches trained on the semi-supervised version of the dataset outperform their unsupervised counterparts, highlighting a need for approaches more robust to contaminated training data. Furthermore, results show that the threshold used can have a large influence on detection performance, hence more work needs to be invested in methods to find a suitable threshold without the need for labelled data.</p></details> |  |

The model adopts quantile forecasting and multi-token prediction, improving both probabilistic accuracy and inference efficiency. On the Gift-Eval benchmark, it ranks among the top pretrained models while achieving a strong trade-off between accuracy, speed, and model size. Compared to Moirai 1.0, Moirai 2.0 replaces masked-encoder training, multi-patch inputs, and mixture-distribution outputs with a simpler decoder-only architecture, single patch, and quantile loss. Ablation studies isolate these changes -- showing that the decoder-only backbone along with recursive multi-quantile decoding contribute most to the gains. Additional experiments show that Moirai 2.0 outperforms larger models from the same family and exhibits robust domain-level results. In terms of efficiency and model size, Moirai 2.0 is twice as fast and thirty times smaller than its prior best version, Moirai 1.0-Large, while also performing better. Model performance plateaus with increasing parameter count and declines at longer horizons, motivating future work on data scaling and long-horizon modeling.

| **[STOAT: Spatial-Temporal Probabilistic Causal Inference Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09544v3)** | 2025-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial-temporal causal time series (STC-TS) involve region-specific temporal observations driven by causally relevant covariates and interconnected across geographic or network-based spaces. Existing methods often model spatial and temporal dynamics independently and overlook causality-driven probabilistic forecasting, limiting their predictive power. To address this, we propose STOAT (Spatial-Temporal Probabilistic Causal Inference Network), a novel framework for probabilistic forecasting in STC-TS. The proposed method extends a causal inference approach by incorporating a spatial relation matrix that encodes interregional dependencies (e.g. proximity or connectivity), enabling spatially informed causal effect estimation. The resulting latent series are processed by deep probabilistic models to estimate the parameters of the distributions, enabling calibrated uncertainty modeling. We further explore multiple output distributions (e.g., Gaussian, Student's-$t$, Laplace) to capture region-specific variability. Experiments on COVID-19 data across six countries demonstrate that STOAT outperforms state-of-the-art probabilistic forecasting models (DeepAR, DeepVAR, Deep State Space Model, etc.) in key metrics, particularly in regions with strong spatial dependencies. By bridging causal inference and geospatial probabilistic forecasting, STOAT offers a generalizable framework for complex spatial-temporal tasks, such as epidemic management.</p></details> |  |
| **[R-Tuning: Wavelet-Decomposed Replay and Semantic Alignment for Continual Adaptation of Pretrained Time-Series Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11685v1)** | 2025-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-trained models have demonstrated exceptional generalization capabilities in time-series forecasting; however, adapting them to evolving data distributions remains a significant challenge. A key hurdle lies in accessing the original training data, as fine-tuning solely on new data often leads to catastrophic forgetting. To address this issue, we propose Replay Tuning (R-Tuning), a novel framework designed for the continual adaptation of pre-trained time-series models. R-Tuning constructs a unified latent space that captures both prior and current task knowledge through a frequency-aware replay strategy. Specifically, it augments model-generated samples via wavelet-based decomposition across multiple frequency bands, generating trend-preserving and fusion-enhanced variants to improve representation diversity and replay efficiency. To further reduce reliance on synthetic samples, R-Tuning introduces a latent consistency constraint that aligns new representations with the prior task space. This constraint guides joint optimization within a compact and semantically coherent latent space, ensuring robust knowledge retention and adaptation. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of R-Tuning, which reduces MAE and MSE by up to 46.9% and 46.8%, respectively, on new tasks, while preserving prior knowledge with gains of up to 5.7% and 6.0% on old tasks. Notably, under few-shot settings, R-Tuning outperforms all state-of-the-art baselines even when synthetic proxy samples account for only 5% of the new task dataset.</p></details> |  |

While Mamba-based models have shown strong performance due to their sequence selection capabilities, they still struggle with insufficient focus on critical time steps and incomplete noise suppression, caused by limited selective abilities. To address this, we introduce Repetitive Contrastive Learning (RCL), a token-level contrastive pretraining framework aimed at enhancing Mamba's selective capabilities. RCL pretrains a single Mamba block to strengthen its selective abilities and then transfers these pretrained parameters to initialize Mamba blocks in various backbone models, improving their temporal prediction performance. RCL uses sequence augmentation with Gaussian noise and applies inter-sequence and intra-sequence contrastive learning to help the Mamba module prioritize information-rich time steps while ignoring noisy ones. Extensive experiments show that RCL consistently boosts the performance of backbone models, surpassing existing methods and achieving state-of-the-art results. Additionally, we propose two metrics to quantify Mamba's selective capabilities, providing theoretical, qualitative, and quantitative evidence for the improvements brought by RCL.</p></details> |  |
| **[rfBLT: Random Feature Bayesian Lasso Takens Model for time series forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08957v1)** | 2025-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series prediction is challenging due to our limited understanding of the underlying dynamics. Conventional models such as ARIMA and Holt's linear trend model experience difficulty in identifying nonlinear patterns in time series. In contrast, machine learning models excel at learning complex patterns and handling high-dimensional data; however, they are unable to quantify the uncertainty associated with their predictions, as statistical models do. To overcome these drawbacks, we propose Random Feature Bayesian Lasso Takens (rfBLT) for forecasting time series data. This non-parametric model captures the underlying system via the Takens' theorem and measures the degree of uncertainty with credible intervals. This is achieved by projecting delay embeddings into a higher-dimensional space via random features and applying regularization within the Bayesian framework to identify relevant terms. Our results demonstrate that the rfBLT method is comparable to traditional statistical models on simulated data, while significantly outperforming both conventional and machine learning models when evaluated on real-world data. The proposed algorithm is implemented in an R package, rfBLT.</p></details> |  |

Although recent advances have improved accuracy, most approaches still treat forecasting as a static one-time mapping task, lacking the interaction, reasoning, and adaptability of human experts. This gap limits their usefulness in complex real-world environments. To address this, we propose AlphaCast, a human wisdom-large language model (LLM) intelligence co-reasoning framework that redefines forecasting as an interactive process. The key idea is to enable step-by-step collaboration between human wisdom and LLM intelligence to jointly prepare, generate, and verify forecasts. The framework consists of two stages: (1) automated prediction preparation, where AlphaCast builds a multi-source cognitive foundation comprising a feature set that captures key statistics and time patterns, a domain knowledge base distilled from corpora and historical series, a contextual repository that stores rich information for each time window, and a case base that retrieves optimal strategies via pattern clustering and matching; and (2) generative reasoning and reflective optimization, where AlphaCast integrates statistical temporal features, prior knowledge, contextual information, and forecasting strategies, triggering a meta-reasoning loop for continuous self-correction and strategy refinement. Extensive experiments on short- and long-term datasets show that AlphaCast consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in predictive accuracy.

While there are extensive researches on detecting model generated text, we find that these existing methods are not applicable to time series data due to the fundamental modality difference, as time series usually have lower information density and smoother probability distributions than text data, which limit the discriminative power of token-based detectors. To address this issue, we examine the subtle distributional differences between real and model-generated time series and propose the contraction hypothesis, which states that model-generated time series, unlike real ones, exhibit progressively decreasing uncertainty under recursive forecasting. We formally prove this hypothesis under theoretical assumptions on model behavior and time series structure. Model-generated time series exhibit progressively concentrated distributions under recursive forecasting, leading to uncertainty contraction. We provide empirical validation of the hypothesis across diverse datasets. Building on this insight, we introduce the Uncertainty Contraction Estimator (UCE), a white-box detector that aggregates uncertainty metrics over successive prefixes to identify TSLM-generated time series. Extensive experiments on 32 datasets show that UCE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, offering a reliable and generalizable solution for detecting model-generated time series.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages,12 figures, to be published in AAAI-2026 main track</p></details> |

We show that spectral predictability~$Ω$ -- a simple signal processing metric -- systematically stratifies model family performance, enabling fast model selection. We conduct controlled experiments in four different domains, then further expand our analysis to 51 models and 28 datasets from the GIFT-Eval benchmark. We find that large time series foundation models (TSFMs) systematically outperform lightweight task-trained baselines when $Ω$ is high, while their advantage vanishes as $Ω$ drops. Computing $Ω$ takes seconds per dataset, enabling practitioners to quickly assess whether their data suits TSFM approaches or whether simpler, cheaper models suffice. We demonstrate that $Ω$ stratifies model performance predictably, offering a practical first-pass filter that reduces validation costs while highlighting the need for models that excel on genuinely difficult (low-$Ω$) problems rather than merely optimizing easy ones.</p></details> |  |

While presenting notable progress for the Transformer architecture, iTransformer still lags behind the latest MLP-based models. We attribute this performance gap to unstable inter-channel relationships. To bridge this gap, we propose EMAformer, a simple yet effective model that enhances the Transformer with an auxiliary embedding suite, akin to armor that reinforces its ability. By introducing three key inductive biases, i.e., \textit{global stability}, \textit{phase sensitivity}, and \textit{cross-axis specificity}, EMAformer unlocks the further potential of the Transformer architecture, achieving state-of-the-art performance on 12 real-world benchmarks and reducing forecasting errors by an average of 2.73\% in MSE and 5.15\% in MAE.

While neural network-based models have achieved notable success in this domain, complex channel-dependent models often suffer from performance degradation compared to channel-independent models that do not consider the relationship between components but provide high robustness due to small capacity. In this work, we propose HN-MVTS, a novel architecture that integrates a hypernetwork-based generative prior with an arbitrary neural network forecasting model. The input of this hypernetwork is a learnable embedding matrix of time series components. To restrict the number of new parameters, the hypernetwork learns to generate the weights of the last layer of the target forecasting networks, serving as a data-adaptive regularizer that improves generalization and long-range predictive accuracy. The hypernetwork is used only during the training, so it does not increase the inference time compared to the base forecasting model. Extensive experiments on eight benchmark datasets demonstrate that application of HN-MVTS to the state-of-the-art models (DLinear, PatchTST, TSMixer, etc.) typically improves their performance. Our findings suggest that hypernetwork-driven parameterization offers a promising direction for enhancing existing forecasting techniques in complex scenarios.</p></details> | AAAI 2026 |

Mainstream Transformer- and Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP)-based methods mainly rely on finite look-back windows, limiting their ability to model long-term dependencies and hurting forecasting performance. Naively extending the look-back window proves ineffective, as it not only introduces prohibitive computational complexity, but also drowns vital long-term dependencies in historical noise. To address these challenges, we propose CometNet, a novel Contextual Motif-guided Long-term Time Series Forecasting framework. CometNet first introduces a Contextual Motif Extraction module that identifies recurrent, dominant contextual motifs from complex historical sequences, providing extensive temporal dependencies far exceeding limited look-back windows; Subsequently, a Motif-guided Forecasting module is proposed, which integrates the extracted dominant motifs into forecasting. By dynamically mapping the look-back window to its relevant motifs, CometNet effectively harnesses their contextual information to strengthen long-term forecasting capability. Extensive experimental results on eight real-world datasets have demonstrated that CometNet significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, particularly on extended forecast horizons.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026</p></details> |

We evaluate the effectiveness of this method across several forecasting models, including DLinear (MLP), TimesNet (CNN), and iTrainformer (Transformer), these models represent some of the most recent advances in time series forecasting.

However, existing patch-based methods typically adopt fixed-length segmentation, overlooking the heterogeneity of local temporal dynamics and the decoding heterogeneity of forecasting. Such designs lose details in information-dense regions, introduce redundancy in stable segments, and fail to capture the distinct complexities of short-term and long-term horizons. We propose TimeMosaic, a forecasting framework that aims to address temporal heterogeneity. TimeMosaic employs adaptive patch embedding to dynamically adjust granularity according to local information density, balancing motif reuse with structural clarity while preserving temporal continuity. In addition, it introduces segment-wise decoding that treats each prediction horizon as a related subtask and adapts to horizon-specific difficulty and information requirements, rather than applying a single uniform decoder. Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate that TimeMosaic delivers consistent improvements over existing methods, and our model trained on the large-scale corpus with 321 billion observations achieves performance competitive with state-of-the-art TSFMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by AAAI</p></details> |

Although CFTL has shown promise, current benchmarking practices fall short of accurately assessing its performance. This shortcoming stems from many factors: an over-reliance on small-scale evaluation datasets; inadequate treatment of sample size when computing summary statistics; reporting of suboptimal statistical models; and failing to account for non-negligible risks of overlap between pre-training and test datasets. To address these limitations, we introduce a unified reimplementation of widely-adopted neural forecasting networks, adapting them for the CFTL setup; we pre-train only on proprietary and synthetic data, being careful to prevent test leakage; and we evaluate on 15 large, diverse public forecast competition datasets. Our empirical analysis reveals that statistical models' accuracy is frequently underreported. Notably, we confirm that statistical models and their ensembles consistently outperform existing FFMs by more than 8.2% in sCRPS, and by more than 20% MASE, across datasets. However, we also find that synthetic dataset pre-training does improve the accuracy of a FFM by 7% percent.</p></details> | <details><summary>Thirt...</summary><p>Thirty-Ninth Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems {NeurIPS 2025}.

| **[The Few Govern the Many:Unveiling Few-Layer Dominance for Time Series Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07237v1)** | 2025-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale models are at the forefront of time series (TS) forecasting, dominated by two paradigms: fine-tuning text-based Large Language Models (LLM4TS) and training Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) from scratch. Both approaches share a foundational assumption that scaling up model capacity and data volume leads to improved performance. However, we observe a \textit{\textbf{scaling paradox}} in TS models, revealing a puzzling phenomenon that larger models do \emph{NOT} achieve better performance. Through extensive experiments on two model families across four scales (100M to 1.7B parameters) and diverse data (up to 6B observations), we rigorously confirm that the scaling paradox is a pervasive issue. We then diagnose its root cause by analyzing internal representations, identifying a phenomenon we call \textit{few-layer dominance}: only a small subset of layers are functionally important, while the majority are redundant, under-utilized, and can even distract training. Based on this discovery, we propose a practical method to automatically identify and retain only these dominant layers. In our models, retaining only 21\% of the parameters achieves up to a 12\% accuracy improvement and a 2.7$\times$ inference speedup. We validate the universality of our method on 8 prominent SOTA models (LLM4TS and TSFMs, 90M to 6B), showing that retaining less than 30\% of layers achieves comparable or superior accuracy in over 95\% of tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Factor-Driven Network Informed Restricted Vector Autoregression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02198v2)** | 2025-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-dimensional financial time series often exhibit complex dependence relations driven by both common market structures and latent connections among assets. To capture these characteristics, this paper proposes Factor-Driven Network Informed Restricted Vector Autoregression (FNIRVAR), a model for the common and idiosyncratic components of high-dimensional time series with an underlying unobserved network structure. The common component is modelled by a static factor model, which allows for strong cross-sectional dependence, whilst a network vector autoregressive process captures the residual co-movements due to the idiosyncratic component. An assortative stochastic block model underlies the network VAR, leading to groups of highly co-moving variables in the idiosyncratic component. For estimation, a two-step procedure is proposed, whereby the static factors are estimated via principal component analysis, followed by estimation of the network VAR parameters. The method is demonstrated in financial applications to daily returns, intraday returns, and FRED-MD macroeconomic variables. In all cases, the proposed method outperforms a static factor model, as well as a static factor plus LASSO-estimated sparse VAR model, in terms of forecasting and financial performance metrics.</p></details> | 9 pages, 2 figures |

In this paper, we propose Diffolio, a diffusion model designed for multivariate financial time-series forecasting and portfolio construction. Diffolio employs a denoising network with a hierarchical attention architecture, comprising both asset-level and market-level layers. Furthermore, to better reflect cross-sectional correlations, we introduce a correlation-guided regularizer informed by a stable estimate of the target correlation matrix. This structure effectively extracts salient features not only from historical returns but also from asset-specific and systematic covariates, significantly enhancing the performance of forecasts and portfolios. Experimental results on the daily excess returns of 12 industry portfolios show that Diffolio outperforms various probabilistic forecasting baselines in multivariate forecasting accuracy and portfolio performance. Moreover, in portfolio experiments, portfolios constructed from Diffolio's forecasts show consistently robust performance, thereby outperforming those from benchmarks by achieving higher Sharpe ratios for the mean-variance tangency portfolio and higher certainty equivalents for the growth-optimal portfolio. These results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed Diffolio in terms of not only statistical accuracy but also economic significance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Time-Prompt: Integrated Heterogeneous Prompts for Unlocking LLMs in Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17631v3)** | 2025-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting aims to model temporal dependencies among variables for future state inference, holding significant importance and widespread applications in real-world scenarios. Although deep learning-based methods have achieved remarkable progress, they still exhibit suboptimal performance in long-term forecasting. Recent research demonstrates that large language models (LLMs) achieve promising performance in time series forecasting, but this progress is still met with skepticism about whether LLMs are truly useful for this task. To address this, we propose Time-Prompt, a framework for activating LLMs for time series forecasting. Specifically, we first construct a unified prompt paradigm with learnable soft prompts to guide the LLM's behavior and textualized hard prompts to enhance the time series representations. Second, to enhance LLM' comprehensive understanding of the forecasting task, we design a semantic space embedding and cross-modal alignment module to achieve fusion of temporal and textual data. Finally, we efficiently fine-tune the LLM's parameters using time series data. Furthermore, we focus on carbon emissions, aiming to provide a modest contribution to global carbon neutrality. Comprehensive evaluations on 6 public datasets and 3 carbon emission datasets demonstrate that Time-Prompt is a powerful framework for time series forecasting.</p></details> |  |

However, some machine learning models function as black boxes, making interpretability a critical concern. One approach to address this issue is counterfactual explanation (CE), which aims to provide insights into model predictions. This study focuses on the relatively underexplored problem of generating counterfactual explanations for time series forecasting. We propose a method for extracting CEs in time series forecasting using exogenous variables, which are frequently encountered in fields such as business and marketing. In addition, we present methods for analyzing the influence of each variable over an entire time series, generating CEs by altering only specific variables, and evaluating the quality of the resulting CEs. We validate the proposed method through theoretical analysis and empirical experiments, showcasing its accuracy and practical applicability. These contributions are expected to support real-world decision-making based on time series data analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>27pag...</summary><p>27pages,9figures,9tables</p></details> |

Consequently, most forecasting methods display compromised robustness to concept drift, despite the prevalent application of instance normalization. We tackle this challenge by first analysing concept drift through a bias-variance lens and proving that weighted ensemble reduces variance without increasing bias. These insights motivate DeepBooTS, a novel end-to-end dual-stream residual-decreasing boosting method that progressively reconstructs the intrinsic signal. In our design, each block of a deep model becomes an ensemble of learners with an auxiliary output branch forming a highway to the final prediction. The block-wise outputs correct the residuals of previous blocks, leading to a learning-driven decomposition of both inputs and targets. This method enhances versatility and interpretability while substantially improving robustness to concept drift. Extensive experiments, including those on large-scale datasets, show that the proposed method outperforms existing methods by a large margin, yielding an average performance improvement of 15.8% across various datasets, establishing a new benchmark for TS forecasting.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages,17 pages, Published in AAAI-26</p></details> |

The model is trained in a Bayesian framework that accounts for the uncertainty about the latent function. We couple the latent GP variable with two types of forecast distributions: the negative binomial (NegBinGP) and the Tweedie distribution (TweedieGP). While the negative binomial has already been used in forecasting intermittent time series, this is the first time in which a fully parameterized Tweedie density is used for intermittent time series. We properly evaluate the Tweedie density, which has both a point mass at zero and heavy tails, avoiding simplifying assumptions made in existing models. We test our models on thousands of intermittent count time series. Results show that our models provide consistently better probabilistic forecasts than the competitors. In particular, TweedieGP obtains the best estimates of the highest quantiles, thus showing that it is more flexible than NegBinGP.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in International Journal of Forecasting</p></details> |
| **[A Weak Penalty Neural ODE for Learning Chaotic Dynamics from Noisy Time Series](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06609v1)** | 2025-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate forecasting of complex high-dimensional dynamical systems from observational data is essential for several applications across science and engineering. A key challenge, however, is that real-world measurements are often corrupted by noise, which severely degrades the performance of data-driven models. Particularly, in chaotic dynamical systems, where small errors amplify rapidly, it is challenging to identify a data-driven model from noisy data that achieves short-term accuracy while preserving long-term invariant properties. In this paper, we propose the use of the weak formulation as a complementary approach to the classical strong formulation of data-driven time-series forecasting models. Specifically, we focus on the neural ordinary differential equation (NODE) architecture. Unlike the standard strong formulation, which relies on the discretization of the NODE followed by optimization, the weak formulation constrains the model using a set of integrated residuals over temporal subdomains. While such a formulation yields an effective NODE model, we discover that the performance of a NODE can be further enhanced by employing this weak formulation as a penalty alongside the classical strong formulation-based learning. Through numerical demonstrations, we illustrate that our proposed training strategy, which we coined as the Weak-Penalty NODE (WP-NODE), achieves state-of-the-art forecasting accuracy and exceptional robustness across benchmark chaotic dynamical systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Counterfactual Forecasting For Panel Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06189v1)** | 2025-11-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We address the challenge of forecasting counterfactual outcomes in a panel data with missing entries and temporally dependent latent factors -- a common scenario in causal inference, where estimating unobserved potential outcomes ahead of time is essential. We propose Forecasting Counterfactuals under Stochastic Dynamics (FOCUS), a method that extends traditional matrix completion methods by leveraging time series dynamics of the factors, thereby enhancing the prediction accuracy of future counterfactuals. Building upon a PCA estimator, our method accommodates both stochastic and deterministic components within the factors, and provides a flexible framework for various applications. In case of stationary autoregressive factors and under standard conditions, we derive error bounds and establish asymptotic normality of our estimator. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our method outperforms existing benchmarks when the latent factors have an autoregressive component. We illustrate FOCUS results on HeartSteps, a mobile health study, illustrating its effectiveness in forecasting step counts for users receiving activity prompts, thereby leveraging temporal patterns in user behavior.</p></details> | 32 pages, 6 figures |
| **[LiteCast: A Lightweight Forecaster for Carbon Optimizations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06187v1)** | 2025-11-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Over recent decades, electricity demand has experienced sustained growth through widespread electrification of transportation and the accelerated expansion of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Grids have managed the resulting surges by scaling generation capacity, incorporating additional resources such as solar and wind, and implementing demand-response mechanisms. Altogether, these policies influence a region's carbon intensity by affecting its energy mix. To mitigate the environmental impacts of consumption, carbon-aware optimizations often rely on long-horizon, high-accuracy forecasts of the grid's carbon intensity that typically use compute intensive models with extensive historical energy mix data. In addition to limiting scalability, accuracy improvements do not necessarily translate into proportional increases in savings. Highlighting the need for more efficient forecasting strategies, we argue that carbon forecasting solutions can achieve the majority of savings without requiring highly precise and complex predictions. Instead, it is the preservation of the ranking of forecasts relative to the ground-truth that drives realized savings. In this paper, we present LiteCast, a lightweight time series forecasting method capable of quickly modeling a region's energy mix to estimate its carbon intensity. LiteCast requires only a few days of historical energy and weather data, delivering fast forecasts that can quickly adapt to sudden changes in the electrical grid. Our evaluation in 50 worldwide regions under various real-world workloads shows that LiteCast outperforms state-of-the-art forecasters, delivering 20% higher savings with near-optimal performance, achieving 97% of the maximum attainable average savings, while remaining lightweight, efficient to run, and adaptive to new data.</p></details> |  |
| **[MoTM: Towards a Foundation Model for Time Series Imputation based on Continuous Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13207v3)** | 2025-11-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent years have witnessed a growing interest for time series foundation models, with a strong emphasis on the forecasting task. Yet, the crucial task of out-of-domain imputation of missing values remains largely underexplored. We propose a first step to fill this gap by leveraging implicit neural representations (INRs). INRs model time series as continuous functions and naturally handle various missing data scenarios and sampling rates. While they have shown strong performance within specific distributions, they struggle under distribution shifts. To address this, we introduce MoTM (Mixture of Timeflow Models), a step toward a foundation model for time series imputation. Building on the idea that a new time series is a mixture of previously seen patterns, MoTM combines a basis of INRs, each trained independently on a distinct family of time series, with a ridge regressor that adapts to the observed context at inference. We demonstrate robust in-domain and out-of-domain generalization across diverse imputation scenarios (e.g., block and pointwise missingness, variable sampling rates), paving the way for adaptable foundation imputation models.</p></details> | <details><summary>10th ...</summary><p>10th Workshop on Advanced Analytics and Learning on Temporal Data (AALTD), ECML 2025</p></details> |
| **[Predicting the Future by Retrieving the Past](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05859v1)** | 2025-11-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning models such as MLP, Transformer, and TCN have achieved remarkable success in univariate time series forecasting, typically relying on sliding window samples from historical data for training. However, while these models implicitly compress historical information into their parameters during training, they are unable to explicitly and dynamically access this global knowledge during inference, relying only on the local context within the lookback window. This results in an underutilization of rich patterns from the global history. To bridge this gap, we propose Predicting the Future by Retrieving the Past (PFRP), a novel approach that explicitly integrates global historical data to enhance forecasting accuracy. Specifically, we construct a Global Memory Bank (GMB) to effectively store and manage global historical patterns. A retrieval mechanism is then employed to extract similar patterns from the GMB, enabling the generation of global predictions. By adaptively combining these global predictions with the outputs of any local prediction model, PFRP produces more accurate and interpretable forecasts. Extensive experiments conducted on seven real-world datasets demonstrate that PFRP significantly enhances the average performance of advanced univariate forecasting models by 8.4\%.

Despite their primary goal of universal time series forecasting, their efficacy is far from uniform; divergent training protocols and data sources cause individual TSFMs to exhibit highly variable performance across different forecasting tasks, domains, and horizons. Leveraging this complementary expertise by arbitrating existing TSFM outputs presents a compelling strategy, yet this remains a largely unexplored area of research. In this paper, we conduct a thorough examination of how different TSFMs exhibit specialized performance profiles across various forecasting settings, and how we can effectively leverage this behavior in arbitration between different time series models. We specifically analyze how factors such as model selection and forecast horizon distribution can influence the efficacy of arbitration strategies. Based on this analysis, we propose Synapse, a novel arbitration framework for TSFMs. Synapse is designed to dynamically leverage a pool of TSFMs, assign and adjust predictive weights based on their relative, context-dependent performance, and construct a robust forecast distribution by adaptively sampling from the output quantiles of constituent models. Experimental results demonstrate that Synapse consistently outperforms other popular ensembling techniques as well as individual TSFMs, demonstrating Synapse's efficacy in time series forecasting.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 7 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[Multi-period Learning for Financial Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08622v1)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting is important in finance domain. Financial time series (TS) patterns are influenced by both short-term public opinions and medium-/long-term policy and market trends. Hence, processing multi-period inputs becomes crucial for accurate financial time series forecasting (TSF). However, current TSF models either use only single-period input, or lack customized designs for addressing multi-period characteristics. In this paper, we propose a Multi-period Learning Framework (MLF) to enhance financial TSF performance. MLF considers both TSF's accuracy and efficiency requirements. Specifically, we design three new modules to better integrate the multi-period inputs for improving accuracy: (i) Inter-period Redundancy Filtering (IRF), that removes the information redundancy between periods for accurate self-attention modeling, (ii) Learnable Weighted-average Integration (LWI), that effectively integrates multi-period forecasts, (iii) Multi-period self-Adaptive Patching (MAP), that mitigates the bias towards certain periods by setting the same number of patches across all periods. Furthermore, we propose a Patch Squeeze module to reduce the number of patches in self-attention modeling for maximized efficiency. MLF incorporates multiple inputs with varying lengths (periods) to achieve better accuracy and reduces the costs of selecting input lengths during training.

In this study, we explore how data augmentation can mitigate Membership Inference Attacks (MIA) on TSF models. We show that retraining with synthetic data can substantially reduce the effectiveness of loss-based MIAs by reducing the attacker's true-positive to false-positive ratio. The key challenge is generating synthetic samples that closely resemble the original training data to confuse the attacker, while also introducing enough novelty to enhance the model's ability to generalize to unseen data. We examine multiple augmentation strategies - Zeroth-Order Optimization (ZOO), a variant of ZOO constrained by Principal Component Analysis (ZOO-PCA), and MixUp - to strengthen model resilience without sacrificing accuracy. Our experimental results show that ZOO-PCA yields the best reductions in TPR/FPR ratio for MIA attacks without sacrificing performance on test data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a proceedings paper at Machine Learning for Health (ML4H) symposium 2025, December 1-2, 2025, San Diego, United States, 15 pages</p></details> |
| **[Two-stage hybrid models for enhancing forecasting accuracy on heterogeneous time series](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08600v2)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A time series forecasting model--which is typically built on a single time series--is known as a local time series model (tsLM). In contrast, a forecasting model trained on multiple time series is referred to as a global time series model (tsGM). tsGMs can enhance forecasting accuracy and improve generalisation by learning cross-series information. As such, developing tsGMs has become a prominent research focus within the time series forecasting community. However, the benefits of tsGMs may not always be realised if the given set of time series is heterogeneous. While increasing model complexity can help tsGMs adapt to such a set of data, it can also increase the risk of overfitting and forecasting error. Additionally, the definition of homogeneity remains ambiguous in the literature. To address these challenges, this paper explores how to define data heterogeneity and proposes a two-stage modelling framework: At stage one, a tsGM is learnt to identify homogeneous patterns; and at stage two, tsLMs (e.g., ARIMA) or sub-tsGMs tailored to different groups are learnt to capture the heterogeneity. Numerical experiments on four open datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms six state-of-the-art models. These results highlight its effectiveness in unlocking the full potential of global forecasting models for heterogeneous datasets.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures |

While existing filtering and strategic deployment techniques optimize collected data volume at the edge, they overlook how variations in sampling frequencies and spatial coverage affect downstream model performance. In many forecasting models, incorporating data from additional sensors denoise predictions by providing broader spatial contexts. This interplay between sampling frequency, spatial coverage and different forecasting model architectures remain underexplored. This work presents a systematic study of forecasting models - classical models (VAR), neural networks (GRU, Transformer), spatio-temporal graph neural networks (STGNNs), and time series foundation models (TSFMs: Chronos Moirai, TimesFM) under varying spatial sensor nodes density and sampling intervals using real-world temperature data in a wireless sensor network. Our results show that STGNNs are effective when sensor deployments are sparse and sampling rate is moderate, leveraging spatial correlations via encoded graph structure to compensate for limited coverage. In contrast, TSFMs perform competitively at high frequencies but degrade when spatial coverage from neighboring sensors is reduced. Crucially, the multivariate TSFM Moirai outperforms all models by natively learning cross-sensor dependencies. These findings offer actionable insights for building efficient forecasting pipelines in spatio-temporal systems.

It is a powerful forecasting tool for variables displaying inherent seasonal patterns across multiple time scales, as is often observed in energy, economic, and financial time series. The architecture of RNN(p) models, characterised by structured feedbacks across time lags, enables the design of efficient training strategies. We conduct a comparative study of learning algorithms for these models, providing a rigorous analysis of their computational complexity and training performance. We present two applications of RNN(p) models in power consumption forecasting, a key domain within the energy sector where accurate forecasts inform both operational and financial decisions. Experimental results show that RNN(p) models achieve excellent forecasting accuracy while maintaining a high degree of interpretability. These features make them well-suited for decision-making in energy markets and other fintech applications where reliable predictions play a significant economic role.</p></details> |  |
| **[Carbon Price Forecasting with Structural Breaks: A Comparative Study of Deep Learning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04988v1)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately forecasting carbon prices is essential for informed energy market decision-making, guiding sustainable energy planning, and supporting effective decarbonization strategies. However, it remains challenging due to structural breaks and high-frequency noise caused by frequent policy interventions and market shocks. Existing studies, including the most recent baseline approaches, have attempted to incorporate breakpoints but often treat denoising and modeling as separate processes and lack systematic evaluation across advanced deep learning architectures, limiting the robustness and the generalization capability. To address these gaps, this paper proposes a comprehensive hybrid framework that integrates structural break detection (Bai-Perron, ICSS, and PELT algorithms), wavelet signal denoising, and three state-of-the-art deep learning models (LSTM, GRU, and TCN). Using European Union Allowance (EUA) spot prices from 2007 to 2024 and exogenous features such as energy prices and policy indicators, the framework constructs univariate and multivariate datasets for comparative evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed PELT-WT-TCN achieves the highest prediction accuracy, reducing forecasting errors by 22.35% in RMSE and 18.63% in MAE compared to the state-of-the-art baseline model (Breakpoints with Wavelet and LSTM), and by 70.55% in RMSE and 74.42% in MAE compared to the original LSTM without decomposition from the same baseline study. These findings underscore the value of integrating structural awareness and multiscale decomposition into deep learning architectures to enhance accuracy and interpretability in carbon price forecasting and other nonstationary financial time series.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we systematically study the effect of tokenizer design, specifically scaling and quantization strategies, on model performance, alongside the impact of pretraining versus random initialization. We show that tokenizer configuration primarily governs the representational capacity and stability of the model, while transfer learning influences optimization efficiency and alignment. Using a combination of empirical training experiments and theoretical analyses, we demonstrate that pretrained models consistently leverage well-designed tokenizers more effectively, particularly at smaller vocabulary sizes. Conversely, misaligned tokenization can diminish or even invert the benefits of pretraining. These findings highlight the importance of careful tokenization in time series modeling and suggest that combining small, efficient vocabularies with pretrained weights is especially advantageous in multi-modal forecasting settings, where the overall vocabulary must be shared across modalities. Our results provide concrete guidance for designing tokenizers and leveraging transfer learning in discrete representation learning for continuous signals.</p></details> |  |

This task is challenging as it switches between domains: the stock price inputs and outputs lie in the time-series domain, while the reasoning step should be in natural language. In this work, we introduce Verbal Technical Analysis (VTA), a novel framework that combine verbal and latent reasoning to produce stock time-series forecasts that are both accurate and interpretable. To reason over time-series, we convert stock price data into textual annotations and optimize the reasoning trace using an inverse Mean Squared Error (MSE) reward objective. To produce time-series outputs from textual reasoning, we condition the outputs of a time-series backbone model on the reasoning-based attributes. Experiments on stock datasets across U.S., Chinese, and European markets show that VTA achieves state-of-the-art forecasting accuracy, while the reasoning traces also perform well on evaluation by industry experts.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICAIF...</summary><p>ICAIF 2025 Workshop (Best Paper)</p></details> |

This paper introduces ForecastGAN, a novel decomposition based adversarial framework addressing limitations in existing approaches for multi-horizon predictions. Although transformer models excel in long-term forecasting, they often underperform in short-term scenarios and typically ignore categorical features. ForecastGAN operates through three integrated modules: a Decomposition Module that extracts seasonality and trend components; a Model Selection Module that identifies optimal neural network configurations based on forecasting horizon; and an Adversarial Training Module that enhances prediction robustness through Conditional Generative Adversarial Network training. Unlike conventional approaches, ForecastGAN effectively integrates both numerical and categorical features. We validate our framework on eleven benchmark multivariate time series datasets that span various forecasting horizons. The results show that ForecastGAN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art transformer models for short-term forecasting while remaining competitive for long-term horizons. This research establishes a more generalizable approach to time series forecasting that adapts to specific contexts while maintaining strong performance across diverse data characteristics without extensive hyperparameter tuning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Porti...</summary><p>Portions of this work were previously published in the author's Master's thesis at University of Windsor (2024)</p></details> |

However, current forecasting solutions lack the temporal and spatial resolution required by system operators. In this paper, we introduce SolarCrossFormer, a novel deep learning model for day-ahead irradiance forecasting, that combines satellite images and time series from a ground-based network of meteorological stations. SolarCrossFormer uses novel graph neural networks to exploit the inter- and intra-modal correlations of the input data and improve the accuracy and resolution of the forecasts. It generates probabilistic forecasts for any location in Switzerland with a 15-minute resolution for horizons up to 24 hours ahead. One of the key advantages of SolarCrossFormer its robustness in real life operations. It can incorporate new time-series data without retraining the model and, additionally, it can produce forecasts for locations without input data by using only their coordinates. Experimental results over a dataset of one year and 127 locations across Switzerland show that SolarCrossFormer yield a normalized mean absolute error of 6.1 % over the forecasting horizon. The results are competitive with those achieved by a commercial numerical weather prediction service.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 18 figures, accepted for publication in IEEE Transactions on Sustainable Energy</p></details> |
| **[AWEMixer: Adaptive Wavelet-Enhanced Mixer Network for Long-Term Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04722v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Forecasting long-term time series in IoT environments remains a significant challenge due to the non-stationary and multi-scale characteristics of sensor signals. Furthermore, error accumulation causes a decrease in forecast quality when predicting further into the future. Traditional methods are restricted to operate in time-domain, while the global frequency information achieved by Fourier transform would be regarded as stationary signals leading to blur the temporal patterns of transient events. We propose AWEMixer, an Adaptive Wavelet-Enhanced Mixer Network including two innovative components: 1) a Frequency Router designs to utilize the global periodicity pattern achieved by Fast Fourier Transform to adaptively weight localized wavelet subband, and 2) a Coherent Gated Fusion Block to achieve selective integration of prominent frequency features with multi-scale temporal representation through cross-attention and gating mechanism, which realizes accurate time-frequency localization while remaining robust to noise. Seven public benchmarks validate that our model is more effective than recent state-of-the-art models. Specifically, our model consistently achieves performance improvement compared with transformer-based and MLP-based state-of-the-art models in long-sequence time series forecasting.

| **[Stochastic Diffusion: A Diffusion Probabilistic Model for Stochastic Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02827v3)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent innovations in diffusion probabilistic models have paved the way for significant progress in image, text and audio generation, leading to their applications in generative time series forecasting. However, leveraging such abilities to model highly stochastic time series data remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel Stochastic Diffusion (StochDiff) model which learns data-driven prior knowledge at each time step by utilizing the representational power of the stochastic latent spaces to model the variability of the multivariate time series data. The learnt prior knowledge helps the model to capture complex temporal dynamics and the inherent uncertainty of the data. This improves its ability to model highly stochastic time series data. Through extensive experiments on real-world datasets, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model on stochastic time series forecasting. Additionally, we showcase an application of our model for real-world surgical guidance, highlighting its potential to benefit the medical community.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 4 figures.

| **[Benchmark Datasets for Lead-Lag Forecasting on Social Platforms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03877v1)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Social and collaborative platforms emit multivariate time-series traces in which early interactions-such as views, likes, or downloads-are followed, sometimes months or years later, by higher impact like citations, sales, or reviews. We formalize this setting as Lead-Lag Forecasting (LLF): given an early usage channel (the lead), predict a correlated but temporally shifted outcome channel (the lag). Despite the ubiquity of such patterns, LLF has not been treated as a unified forecasting problem within the time-series community, largely due to the absence of standardized datasets. To anchor research in LLF, here we present two high-volume benchmark datasets-arXiv (accesses -> citations of 2.3M papers) and GitHub (pushes/stars -> forks of 3M repositories)-and outline additional domains with analogous lead-lag dynamics, including Wikipedia (page views -> edits), Spotify (streams -> concert attendance), e-commerce (click-throughs -> purchases), and LinkedIn profile (views -> messages). Our datasets provide ideal testbeds for lead-lag forecasting, by capturing long-horizon dynamics across years, spanning the full spectrum of outcomes, and avoiding survivorship bias in sampling. We documented all technical details of data curation and cleaning, verified the presence of lead-lag dynamics through statistical and classification tests, and benchmarked parametric and non-parametric baselines for regression. Our study establishes LLF as a novel forecasting paradigm and lays an empirical foundation for its systematic exploration in social and usage data. Our data portal with downloads and documentation is available at https://lead-lag-forecasting.github.io/.</p></details> |  |

To predict the next-patch's distribution, we propose a TimeFlow Loss based on flow-matching, which facilitates native pre-training of Transformers on continuous-valued time series without discrete tokenization. Conditioned on arbitrary-length time series, our models are pre-trained without specifying any prior distribution and can generate multiple probable predictions, achieving more flexibility in representation learning than using parametric densities. Towards time series foundation models, we leverage minimal but crucial adaptations of Transformers and curate TimeBench with one trillion time points, comprising mostly real-world datasets and synthetic data. By mitigating mode collapse via TimeFlow Loss, we pre-train a family of Sundial models on TimeBench, which achieve unprecedented model capacity and generalization performance. In addition to excellent scalability, Sundial achieves state-of-the-art results on both point and probabilistic forecasting benchmarks with a just-in-time inference speed, i.e., making zero-shot predictions within a few milliseconds. We believe that Sundial's pioneering generative forecasting capability can improve model reliability in real-world decision-making.

| **[ReNF: Rethinking the Design Space of Neural Long-Term Time Series Forecasters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25914v4)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural Forecasters (NFs) are a cornerstone of Long-term Time Series Forecasting (LTSF). However, progress has been hampered by an overemphasis on architectural complexity at the expense of fundamental forecasting principles. In this work, we return to first principles to redesign the LTSF paradigm. We begin by introducing a Multiple Neural Forecasting Theorem that provides a theoretical basis for our approach. We propose Boosted Direct Output (BDO), a novel forecasting strategy that synergistically combines the advantages of both Auto-Regressive (AR) and Direct Output (DO). In addition, we stabilize the learning process by smoothly tracking the model's parameters. Extensive experiments show that these principled improvements enable a simple MLP to achieve state-of-the-art performance, outperforming recent, complex models in nearly all cases, without any specific considerations in the area. Finally, we empirically verify our theorem, establishing a dynamic performance bound and identifying promising directions for future research.

| **[Efficient Linear Attention for Multivariate Time Series Modeling via Entropy Equality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03190v1)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Attention mechanisms have been extensively employed in various applications, including time series modeling, owing to their capacity to capture intricate dependencies; however, their utility is often constrained by quadratic computational complexity, which impedes scalability for long sequences. In this work, we propose a novel linear attention mechanism designed to overcome these limitations. Our approach is grounded in a theoretical demonstration that entropy, as a strictly concave function on the probability simplex, implies that distributions with aligned probability rankings and similar entropy values exhibit structural resemblance. Building on this insight, we develop an efficient approximation algorithm that computes the entropy of dot-product-derived distributions with only linear complexity, enabling the implementation of a linear attention mechanism based on entropy equality. Through rigorous analysis, we reveal that the effectiveness of attention in spatio-temporal time series modeling may not primarily stem from the non-linearity of softmax but rather from the attainment of a moderate and well-balanced weight distribution. Extensive experiments on four spatio-temporal datasets validate our method, demonstrating competitive or superior forecasting performance while achieving substantial reductions in both memory usage and computational time.</p></details> |  |
| **[Forecast2Anomaly (F2A): Adapting Multivariate Time Series Foundation Models for Anomaly Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03149v1)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Forecasting anomalies (anomaly prediction) in multivariate time series from different real-world, dynamic, and complex systems is vital for preempting critical failures, leading to a substantial minimization in operational costs and human labor. Yet, existing methods are limited to specific systems while failing to generalize to evolving anomaly patterns over time. In contrast, pretrained Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) have recently demonstrated strong generalization and zero-shot forecasting capabilities. However, their potential remains untapped for anomaly prediction, a task fundamentally different from forecasting normal behavior. Thus, we present Forecast2Anomaly (F2A), a novel framework that empowers TSFMs with anomaly prediction abilities through two key innovations. First, we propose a joint forecast-anomaly loss that fine-tunes TSFMs to accurately forecast future signals even at anomalous time points. Second, we introduce a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) module that retrieves historically relevant horizons and conditions predictions on them. This component dynamically adapts to distributional shifts at inference time, enabling F2A to track evolving anomalies without requiring model updates. By combining targeted fine-tuning with dynamic retrieval, F2A bridges the gap between robust TSFM zero-shot forecasting and zero-shot anomaly prediction. Extensive experiments across 16 diverse datasets and multiple TSFM backbones show that F2A consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, offering a scalable, zero-shot anomaly prediction solution for real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

Toto uses a modern decoder-only architecture coupled with architectural innovations designed to account for specific challenges found in multivariate observability time series data. Toto's pre-training corpus is a mixture of observability data, open datasets, and synthetic data, and is 4-10$\times$ larger than those of leading time series foundation models. Additionally, we introduce BOOM, a large-scale benchmark consisting of 350 million observations across 2,807 real-world time series. For both Toto and BOOM, we source observability data exclusively from Datadog's own telemetry and internal observability metrics. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that Toto achieves state-of-the-art performance on both BOOM and on established general purpose time series forecasting benchmarks. Toto's model weights, inference code, and evaluation scripts, as well as BOOM's data and evaluation code, are all available as open source under the Apache 2.0 License available at https://huggingface.co/Datadog/Toto-Open-Base-1.0 and https://github.com/DataDog/toto.</p></details> |  |

While transformer architectures like Informer have shown promise for financial time series forecasting, the application of transformer models for options data remains largely unexplored. We conduct preliminary studies towards the development of a transformer model for options data by training the Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture, typically used in modern image recognition and classification systems, to predict the realized volatility of an asset over the next 30 days from its implied volatility surface (augmented with date information) for a single day. We show that the ViT can learn seasonal patterns and nonlinear features from the IV surface, suggesting a promising direction for model development.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS Generative AI in Finance</p></details> |

These tasks are typically modeled in an autoregressive fashion, where each token is generated conditional on the preceding ones, and beam search is commonly used to balance exploration and fluency during decoding. While deep learning models and Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at capturing statistical patterns in this setting, they remain ill-equipped to guarantee compliance with formal constraints. In this paper, we introduce ABS: a general and model-agnostic inference-time algorithm that guarantees compliance with any constraint that can be compiled into a Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA), without requiring retraining. ABS leverages the DFA to guide a constrained variant of beam search: at each decoding step, transitions leading to violations are masked, while remaining paths are dynamically re-ranked according to both the model's probabilities and the automaton's acceptance structure. We formally prove that the resulting sequences are guaranteed to satisfy the given constraints, and we empirically demonstrate that ABS also improves output quality. We validate our approach on three distinct tasks: constrained image-stream classification, controlled text generation, and text infilling. In all settings, ABS achieves perfect constraint satisfaction, while outperforming or matching state-of-the-art baselines on standard quality metrics and efficiency.</p></details> |  |

Fuel distributors specifically require precise estimates to avoid inventory shortages or excesses. However, there is a lack of studies that analyze the jet fuel demand forecasting problem using machine learning models. Instead, many industry practitioners rely on deterministic or expertise-based models. In this research, we evaluate the performance of data-driven approaches using a substantial amount of data obtained from a major aviation fuel distributor in the Danish market. Our analysis compares the predictive capabilities of traditional time series models, Prophet, LSTM sequence-to-sequence neural networks, and hybrid models. A key challenge in developing these models is the required forecasting horizon, as fuel demand needs to be predicted for the next 30 days to optimize sourcing strategies. To ensure the reliability of the data-driven approaches and provide valuable insights to practitioners, we analyze three different datasets. The primary objective of this study is to present a comprehensive case study on jet fuel demand forecasting, demonstrating the advantages of employing data-driven models and highlighting the impact of incorporating additional variables in the predictive models.</p></details> |  |

Currently, the Irish dairy sector, a significant economic contributor, grapples with challenges related to profitability and sustainability. Presently, grass growth forecasting relies on impractical mechanistic models. In response, we propose deep learning models tailored for univariate datasets, presenting cost-effective alternatives. Notably, a temporal convolutional network designed for forecasting Perennial Ryegrass growth in Cork exhibits high performance, leveraging historical grass height data with RMSE of 2.74 and MAE of 3.46. Validation across a comprehensive dataset spanning 1,757 weeks over 34 years provides insights into optimal model configurations. This study enhances our understanding of model behavior, thereby improving reliability in grass growth forecasting and contributing to the advancement of sustainable dairy farming practices.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages (two-columns), 7 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[A Novel Reservoir Computing Framework for Chaotic Time Series Prediction Using Time Delay Embedding and Random Fourier Features](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02877v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Forecasting chaotic time series requires models that can capture the intrinsic geometry of the underlying attractor while remaining computationally efficient. We introduce a novel reservoir computing (RC) framework that integrates time-delay embedding with Random Fourier Feature (RFF) mappings to construct a dynamical reservoir without the need for traditional recurrent architectures. Unlike standard RC, which relies on high-dimensional recurrent connectivity, the proposed RFF-RC explicitly approximates nonlinear kernel transformations that uncover latent dynamical relations in the reconstructed phase space. This hybrid formulation offers two key advantages: (i) it provides a principled way to approximate complex nonlinear interactions among delayed coordinates, thereby enriching the effective dynamical representation of the reservoir, and (ii) it reduces reliance on manual reservoir hyperparameters such as spectral radius and leaking rate. We evaluate the framework on canonical chaotic systems-the Mackey-Glass equation, the Lorenz system, and the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation. This novel formulation demonstrates that RFF-RC not only achieves superior prediction accuracy but also yields robust attractor reconstructions and long-horizon forecasts. These results show that the combination of delay embedding and RFF-based reservoirs reveals new dynamical structure by embedding the system in an enriched feature space, providing a computationally efficient and interpretable approach to modeling chaotic dynamics.</p></details> |  |

A Comprehensive Benchmark for GNSS-based Precipitation Nowcasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25263v3)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Precipitation Nowcasting, which aims to predict precipitation within the next 0 to 6 hours, is critical for disaster mitigation and real-time response planning. However, most time series forecasting benchmarks in meteorology are evaluated on variables with strong periodicity, such as temperature and humidity, which fail to reflect model capabilities in more complex and practically meteorology scenarios like precipitation nowcasting. To address this gap, we propose RainfallBench, a benchmark designed for precipitation nowcasting, a highly challenging and practically relevant task characterized by zero inflation, temporal decay, and non-stationarity, focusing on predicting precipitation within the next 0 to 6 hours. The dataset is derived from five years of meteorological observations, recorded at hourly intervals across six essential variables, and collected from more than 140 Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) stations globally. In particular, it incorporates precipitable water vapor (PWV), a crucial indicator of rainfall that is absent in other datasets. We further design specialized evaluation protocols to assess model performance on key meteorological challenges, including multi-scale prediction, multi-resolution forecasting, and extreme rainfall events, benchmarking 17 state-of-the-art models across six major architectures on RainfallBench. Additionally, to address the zero-inflation and temporal decay issues overlooked by existing models, we introduce Bi-Focus Precipitation Forecaster (BFPF), a plug-and-play module that incorporates domain-specific priors to enhance rainfall time series forecasting. Statistical analysis and ablation studies validate the comprehensiveness of our dataset as well as the superiority of our methodology.</p></details> | 13 pages,11 figures |

Our methodology uses a novel differentiable probabilistic projection layer (DPPL) that can be combined with a wide range of neural network architectures. DPPL allows the model to learn the system in an end-to-end manner, compared to other approaches where constraints are satisfied either through a post-processing step or at inference. ProbHardE2E optimizes a strictly proper scoring rule, without making any distributional assumptions on the target, which enables it to obtain robust distributional estimates (in contrast to existing approaches that generally optimize likelihood-based objectives, which are heavily biased by their distributional assumptions and model choices); and it can incorporate a range of non-linear constraints (increasing the power of modeling and flexibility). We apply ProbHardE2E in learning partial differential equations with uncertainty estimates and to probabilistic time-series forecasting, showcasing it as a broadly applicable general framework that connects these seemingly disparate domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>45 pa...</summary><p>45 pages, 5 figures, 10 tables</p></details> |

We present DoFlow, a flow based generative model defined over a causal DAG that delivers coherent observational and interventional predictions, as well as counterfactuals through the natural encoding and decoding mechanism of continuous normalizing flows (CNFs). We also provide a supporting counterfactual recovery result under certain assumptions. Beyond forecasting, DoFlow provides explicit likelihoods of future trajectories, enabling principled anomaly detection. Experiments on synthetic datasets with various causal DAG and real world hydropower and cancer treatment time series show that DoFlow achieves accurate system-wide observational forecasting, enables causal forecasting over interventional and counterfactual queries, and effectively detects anomalies. This work contributes to the broader goal of unifying causal reasoning and generative modeling for complex dynamical systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Revisiting Multivariate Time Series Forecasting with Missing Values](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23494v2)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Missing values are common in real-world time series, and multivariate time series forecasting with missing values (MTSF-M) has become a crucial area of research for ensuring reliable predictions. To address the challenge of missing data, current approaches have developed an imputation-then-prediction framework that uses imputation modules to fill in missing values, followed by forecasting on the imputed data. However, this framework overlooks a critical issue: there is no ground truth for the missing values, making the imputation process susceptible to errors that can degrade prediction accuracy. In this paper, we conduct a systematic empirical study and reveal that imputation without direct supervision can corrupt the underlying data distribution and actively degrade prediction accuracy. To address this, we propose a paradigm shift that moves away from imputation and directly predicts from the partially observed time series. We introduce Consistency-Regularized Information Bottleneck (CRIB), a novel framework built on the Information Bottleneck principle. CRIB combines a unified-variate attention mechanism with a consistency regularization scheme to learn robust representations that filter out noise introduced by missing values while preserving essential predictive signals. Comprehensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of CRIB, which predicts accurately even under high missing rates. Our code is available in https://github.com/Muyiiiii/CRIB.</p></details> |  |

The objective of this systematic literature review is hence to provide a comprehensive overview of the various modeling approaches and application domains of GNNs for time series classification and forecasting. A database search was conducted, and 366 papers were selected for a detailed examination of the current state-of-the-art in the field. This examination is intended to offer to the reader a comprehensive review of proposed models, links to related source code, available datasets, benchmark models, and fitting results. All this information is hoped to assist researchers in their studies. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first and broadest systematic literature review presenting a detailed comparison of results from current spatio-temporal GNN models applied to different domains. In its final part, this review discusses current limitations and challenges in the application of spatio-temporal GNNs, such as comparability, reproducibility, explainability, poor information capacity, and scalability. This paper is complemented by a GitHub repository at https://github.com/FlaGer99/SLR-Spatio-Temporal-GNN.git providing additional interactive tools to further explore the presented findings.</p></details> |  |

Existing models often focus on disentangling and separately modeling spatial and temporal patterns based on relationships between data points. However, these approaches struggle to adapt to the random missing positions, and fail to learn long-term and large-scale dependencies, which are essential in extensive missing conditions. In this paper, patterns are categorized into two types to handle various missing data conditions: primary patterns, which originate from internal relationships between data points, and auxiliary patterns, influenced by external factors like timestamps and node attributes. Accordingly, we propose the Primary-Auxiliary Spatio-Temporal network (PAST). It comprises a graph-integrated module (GIM) and a cross-gated module (CGM). GIM captures primary patterns via dynamic graphs with interval-aware dropout and multi-order convolutions, and CGM extracts auxiliary patterns through bidirectional gating on embedded external features. The two modules interact via shared hidden vectors and are trained under an ensemble self-supervised framework. Experiments on three datasets under 27 missing data conditions demonstrate that the imputation accuracy of PAST outperforms seven state-of-the-art baselines by up to 26.2% in RMSE and 31.6% in MAE.</p></details> |  |

However, for these models to be trusted in such a safety-critical domain, they must first possess robust perception capabilities, i.e., they must be capable of understanding a traffic scene, which can often be highly complex, with many things happening simultaneously. Moreover, since critical objects and agents in traffic scenes are often at long distances, we require systems with not only strong perception capabilities at close distances (up to 20 meters), but also at long (30+ meters) range. Therefore, it is important to evaluate the perception capabilities of these models in isolation from other skills like reasoning or advanced world knowledge. Distance-Annotated Traffic Perception Question Answering (DTPQA) is a Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmark designed specifically for this purpose: it can be used to evaluate the perception systems of VLMs in traffic scenarios using trivial yet crucial questions relevant to driving decisions. It consists of two parts: a synthetic benchmark (DTP-Synthetic) created using a simulator, and a real-world benchmark (DTP-Real) built on top of existing images of real traffic scenes. Additionally, DTPQA includes distance annotations, i.e., how far the object in question is from the camera. More specifically, each DTPQA sample consists of (at least): (a) an image, (b) a question, (c) the ground truth answer, and (d) the distance of the object in question, enabling analysis of how VLM performance degrades with increasing object distance. In this article, we provide the dataset itself along with the Python scripts used to create it, which can be used to generate additional data of the same kind.</p></details> |  |
| **[T2I-Based Physical-World Appearance Attack against Traffic Sign Recognition Systems in Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12956v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic Sign Recognition (TSR) systems play a critical role in Autonomous Driving (AD) systems, enabling real-time detection of road signs, such as STOP and speed limit signs. While these systems are increasingly integrated into commercial vehicles, recent research has exposed their vulnerability to physical-world adversarial appearance attacks. In such attacks, carefully crafted visual patterns are misinterpreted by TSR models as legitimate traffic signs, while remaining inconspicuous or benign to human observers. However, existing adversarial appearance attacks suffer from notable limitations. Pixel-level perturbation-based methods often lack stealthiness and tend to overfit to specific surrogate models, resulting in poor transferability to real-world TSR systems. On the other hand, text-to-image (T2I) diffusion model-based approaches demonstrate limited effectiveness and poor generalization to out-of-distribution sign types. In this paper, we present DiffSign, a novel T2I-based appearance attack framework designed to generate physically robust, highly effective, transferable, practical, and stealthy appearance attacks against TSR systems. To overcome the limitations of prior approaches, we propose a carefully designed attack pipeline that integrates CLIP-based loss and masked prompts to improve attack focus and controllability. We also propose two novel style customization methods to guide visual appearance and improve out-of-domain traffic sign attack generalization and attack stealthiness. We conduct extensive evaluations of DiffSign under varied real-world conditions, including different distances, angles, light conditions, and sign categories. Our method achieves an average physical-world attack success rate of 83.3%, leveraging DiffSign's high effectiveness in attack transferability.</p></details> | 16 pages, 12 figures |

However, several challenges remain, including insufficient semantic richness of generated traffic elements, limited camera viewpoints, low visual fidelity of synthesized images, and poor alignment between textual descriptions and generated content. To address these issues, we propose a unified text-driven framework for both image generation and editing, leveraging a controllable mask mechanism to seamlessly integrate the two tasks. Furthermore, we incorporate both vehicle-side and roadside multi-view data to enhance the geometric diversity of traffic scenes. Our training strategy follows a two-stage paradigm: first, we perform conceptual learning using large-scale coarse-grained text-image data; then, we fine-tune with fine-grained descriptive data to enhance text-image alignment and detail quality. Additionally, we introduce a mask-region-weighted loss that dynamically emphasizes small yet critical regions during training, thereby substantially enhancing the generation fidelity of small-scale traffic elements. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves leading performance in text-based image generation and editing within traffic scenes.</p></details> |  |
| **[MTP: Exploring Multimodal Urban Traffic Profiling with Modality Augmentation and Spectrum Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10218v2)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With rapid urbanization in the modern era, traffic signals from various sensors have been playing a significant role in monitoring the states of cities, which provides a strong foundation in ensuring safe travel, reducing traffic congestion and optimizing urban mobility. Most existing methods for traffic signal modeling often rely on the original data modality, i.e., numerical direct readings from the sensors in cities. However, this unimodal approach overlooks the semantic information existing in multimodal heterogeneous urban data in different perspectives, which hinders a comprehensive understanding of traffic signals and limits the accurate prediction of complex traffic dynamics. To address this problem, we propose a novel Multimodal framework, MTP, for urban Traffic Profiling, which learns multimodal features through numeric, visual, and textual perspectives. The three branches drive for a multimodal perspective of urban traffic signal learning in the frequency domain, while the frequency learning strategies delicately refine the information for extraction. Specifically, we first conduct the visual augmentation for the traffic signals, which transforms the original modality into frequency images and periodicity images for visual learning. Also, we augment descriptive texts for the traffic signals based on the specific topic, background information and item description for textual learning. To complement the numeric information, we utilize frequency multilayer perceptrons for learning on the original modality. We design a hierarchical contrastive learning on the three branches to fuse the spectrum of three modalities. Finally, extensive experiments on six real-world datasets demonstrate superior performance compared with the state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Machine Unlearning of Traffic State Estimation and Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17984v2)** | 2025-11-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data-driven traffic state estimation and prediction (TSEP) relies heavily on data sources that contain sensitive information. While the abundance of data has fueled significant breakthroughs, particularly in machine learning-based methods, it also raises concerns regarding privacy, cybersecurity, and data freshness. These issues can erode public trust in intelligent transportation systems. Recently, regulations have introduced the "right to be forgotten", allowing users to request the removal of their private data from models. As machine learning models can remember old data, simply removing it from back-end databases is insufficient in such systems. To address these challenges, this study introduces a novel learning paradigm for TSEP-Machine Unlearning TSEP-which enables a trained TSEP model to selectively forget privacy-sensitive, poisoned, or outdated data. By empowering models to "unlearn," we aim to enhance the trustworthiness and reliability of data-driven traffic TSEP.</p></details> |  |

We present CareNet, a router-centric system that transforms household network metadata into interpretable behavioral indicators aligned with DSM-5 depressive-symptom domains. All processing occurs locally at the home gateway, preserving privacy while maintaining visibility of temporal routines. The core contribution is the Fuzzy Additive Symptom Likelihood (FASL), a transparent formulation that fuses header-level metrics into daily criterion-level likelihoods using bounded fuzzy memberships and additive aggregation. Combined with a DSM-style temporal gate, FASL integrates short-term traffic fluctuations into persistent, clinically interpretable indicators. Evaluation on realistic multi-day traces shows that CareNet captures characteristic patterns such as delayed sleep timing and attentional instability without payload inspection. The results highlight the feasibility of reproducible, explainable behavioral inference from router-side telemetry.</p></details> |  |
| **[HyperD: Hybrid Periodicity Decoupling Framework for Traffic Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09275v2)** | 2025-11-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate traffic forecasting plays a vital role in intelligent transportation systems, enabling applications such as congestion control, route planning, and urban mobility optimization. However, traffic forecasting remains challenging due to two key factors: (1) complex spatial dependencies arising from dynamic interactions between road segments and traffic sensors across the network, and (2) the coexistence of multi-scale periodic patterns (e.g., daily and weekly periodic patterns driven by human routines) with irregular fluctuations caused by unpredictable events (e.g., accidents, weather, or construction). To tackle these challenges, we propose HyperD (Hybrid Periodic Decoupling), a novel framework that decouples traffic data into periodic and residual components. The periodic component is handled by the Hybrid Periodic Representation Module, which extracts fine-grained daily and weekly patterns using learnable periodic embeddings and spatial-temporal attention. The residual component, which captures non-periodic, high-frequency fluctuations, is modeled by the Frequency-Aware Residual Representation Module, leveraging complex-valued MLP in frequency domain. To enforce semantic separation between the two components, we further introduce a Dual-View Alignment Loss, which aligns low-frequency information with the periodic branch and high-frequency information with the residual branch. Extensive experiments on four real-world traffic datasets demonstrate that HyperD achieves state-of-the-art prediction accuracy, while offering superior robustness under disturbances and improved computational efficiency compared to existing methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Ground Plane Projection for Improved Traffic Analytics at Intersections](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12342v1)** | 2025-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate turning movement counts at intersections are important for signal control, traffic management and urban planning. Computer vision systems for automatic turning movement counts typically rely on visual analysis in the image plane of an infrastructure camera. Here we explore potential advantages of back-projecting vehicles detected in one or more infrastructure cameras to the ground plane for analysis in real-world 3D coordinates. For single-camera systems we find that back-projection yields more accurate trajectory classification and turning movement counts. We further show that even higher accuracy can be achieved through weak fusion of back-projected detections from multiple cameras. These results suggeest that traffic should be analyzed on the ground plane, not the image plane</p></details> |  |
| **[CATS-V2V: A Real-World Vehicle-to-Vehicle Cooperative Perception Dataset with Complex Adverse Traffic Scenarios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11168v1)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) cooperative perception has great potential to enhance autonomous driving performance by overcoming perception limitations in complex adverse traffic scenarios (CATS). Meanwhile, data serves as the fundamental infrastructure for modern autonomous driving AI. However, due to stringent data collection requirements, existing datasets focus primarily on ordinary traffic scenarios, constraining the benefits of cooperative perception. To address this challenge, we introduce CATS-V2V, the first-of-its-kind real-world dataset for V2V cooperative perception under complex adverse traffic scenarios. The dataset was collected by two hardware time-synchronized vehicles, covering 10 weather and lighting conditions across 10 diverse locations. The 100-clip dataset includes 60K frames of 10 Hz LiDAR point clouds and 1.26M multi-view 30 Hz camera images, along with 750K anonymized yet high-precision RTK-fixed GNSS and IMU records. Correspondingly, we provide time-consistent 3D bounding box annotations for objects, as well as static scenes to construct a 4D BEV representation. On this basis, we propose a target-based temporal alignment method, ensuring that all objects are precisely aligned across all sensor modalities. We hope that CATS-V2V, the largest-scale, most supportive, and highest-quality dataset of its kind to date, will benefit the autonomous driving community in related tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Strada-LLM: Graph LLM for traffic prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20856v3)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic forecasting is pivotal for intelligent transportation systems, where accurate and interpretable predictions can significantly enhance operational efficiency and safety. A key challenge stems from the heterogeneity of traffic conditions across diverse locations, leading to highly varied traffic data distributions. Large language models (LLMs) show exceptional promise for few-shot learning in such dynamic and data-sparse scenarios. However, existing LLM-based solutions often rely on prompt-tuning, which can struggle to fully capture complex graph relationships and spatiotemporal dependencies-thereby limiting adaptability and interpretability in real-world traffic networks. We address these gaps by introducing Strada-LLM, a novel multivariate probabilistic forecasting LLM that explicitly models both temporal and spatial traffic patterns. By incorporating proximal traffic information as covariates, Strada-LLM more effectively captures local variations and outperforms prompt-based existing LLMs. To further enhance adaptability, we propose a lightweight distribution-derived strategy for domain adaptation, enabling parameter-efficient model updates when encountering new data distributions or altered network topologies-even under few-shot constraints. Empirical evaluations on spatio-temporal transportation datasets demonstrate that Strada-LLM consistently surpasses state-of-the-art LLM-driven and traditional GNN-based predictors. Specifically, it improves long-term forecasting by 17% in RMSE error and 16% more efficiency. Moreover, it maintains robust performance across different LLM backbones with minimal degradation, making it a versatile and powerful solution for real-world traffic prediction tasks.</p></details> | 13 pages |
| **[Advanced Tool for Traffic Crash Analysis: An AI-Driven Multi-Agent Approach to Pre-Crash Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10853v1)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic collision reconstruction traditionally relies on human expertise, often yielding inconsistent results when analyzing incomplete multimodal data. This study develops a multi-agent AI framework that reconstructs pre-crash scenarios and infers vehicle behaviors from fragmented collision data. We present a two-phase collaborative framework combining reconstruction and reasoning phases. The system processes 277 rear-end lead vehicle deceleration (LVD) collisions from the Crash Investigation Sampling System, integrating textual crash reports, structured tabular data, and visual scene diagrams. Phase I generates natural-language crash reconstructions from multimodal inputs. Phase II performs in-depth crash reasoning by combining these reconstructions with temporal Event Data Recorder (EDR).For validation, we applied it to all LVD cases, focusing on a subset of 39 complex crashes where multiple EDR records per collision introduced ambiguity (e.g., due to missing or conflicting data).The evaluation of the 39 LVD crash cases revealed our framework achieved perfect accuracy across all test cases, successfully identifying both the most relevant EDR event and correctly distinguishing striking versus struck vehicles, surpassing the 92% accuracy achieved by human researchers on the same challenging dataset. The system maintained robust performance even when processing incomplete data, including missing or erroneous EDR records and ambiguous scene diagrams. This study demonstrates superior AI capabilities in processing heterogeneous collision data, providing unprecedented precision in reconstructing impact dynamics and characterizing pre-crash behaviors.</p></details> | 26 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Unlocking Dynamic Inter-Client Spatial Dependencies: A Federated Spatio-Temporal Graph Learning Method for Traffic Flow Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10434v1)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal graphs are powerful tools for modeling complex dependencies in traffic time series. However, the distributed nature of real-world traffic data across multiple stakeholders poses significant challenges in modeling and reconstructing inter-client spatial dependencies while adhering to data locality constraints. Existing methods primarily address static dependencies, overlooking their dynamic nature and resulting in suboptimal performance. In response, we propose Federated Spatio-Temporal Graph with Dynamic Inter-Client Dependencies (FedSTGD), a framework designed to model and reconstruct dynamic inter-client spatial dependencies in federated learning. FedSTGD incorporates a federated nonlinear computation decomposition module to approximate complex graph operations. This is complemented by a graph node embedding augmentation module, which alleviates performance degradation arising from the decomposition. These modules are coordinated through a client-server collective learning protocol, which decomposes dynamic inter-client spatial dependency learning tasks into lightweight, parallelizable subtasks. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that FedSTGD achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art baselines in terms of RMSE, MAE, and MAPE, approaching that of centralized baselines. Ablation studies confirm the contribution of each module in addressing dynamic inter-client spatial dependencies, while sensitivity analysis highlights the robustness of FedSTGD to variations in hyperparameters.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trapped by Their Own Light: Deployable and Stealth Retroreflective Patch Attacks on Traffic Sign Recognition Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10050v1)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic sign recognition plays a critical role in ensuring safe and efficient transportation of autonomous vehicles but remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks using stickers or laser projections. While existing attack vectors demonstrate security concerns, they suffer from visual detectability or implementation constraints, suggesting unexplored vulnerability surfaces in TSR systems. We introduce the Adversarial Retroreflective Patch (ARP), a novel attack vector that combines the high deployability of patch attacks with the stealthiness of laser projections by utilizing retroreflective materials activated only under victim headlight illumination. We develop a retroreflection simulation method and employ black-box optimization to maximize attack effectiveness. ARP achieves $\geq$93.4\% success rate in dynamic scenarios at 35 meters and $\geq$60\% success rate against commercial TSR systems in real-world conditions. Our user study demonstrates that ARP attacks maintain near-identical stealthiness to benign signs while achieving $\geq$1.9\% higher stealthiness scores than previous patch attacks. We propose the DPR Shield defense, employing strategically placed polarized filters, which achieves $\geq$75\% defense success rates for stop signs and speed limit signs against micro-prism patches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Leader-Follower Identification Methodology for Non-Lane Disciplined Heterogeneous Traffic Using Steady State Features](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09946v1)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Road traffic in developing countries, such as India, features a heterogeneous mix of vehicles operating under weak lane discipline (HWLD), encompassing both motorised and non-motorised modes with diverse sizes and manoeuvrability. These conditions lead to complex driver interactions, complicating the reliable identification of vehicle-following (VF) behaviour and leader-follower (LF) pairs. Traditional identification methods based on fixed thresholds for longitudinal and lateral proximity often misclassify non-following instances as valid LF pairs, degrading model performance. This study presents a refined and adaptive method for LF identification in HWLD traffic. It employs vehicle-type- and speed-specific desirable gap thresholds derived from the fundamental density-speed diagram to eliminate false-positive pairs. Additionally, Mexican Hat Wavelet Transform (MWT) is employed to analyse LV and SV speed profiles, verifying LV-SV interaction for LF pair identification. The three-stage filtering includes: (i) speed-gap consistency, (ii) approach/diverge detection via relative velocity sign changes and gap range, and (iii) wavelet-based speed correlation using MWT to confirm LV influence on SV. The framework effectively filters out LF pairs associated with overtaking, tailgating, and inconsistent gap dynamics, retaining only those with consistent VF behaviour and improving model accuracy. Analysis across thirteen LF combinations shows that VF dynamics depend on both SV and LV types. Symmetric pairs (e.g., CAR-CAR, AUTO-CAR) exhibit higher predictability and lower errors, while asymmetric pairs with heavy vehicles or two-wheelers show greater variability. The framework offers a robust foundation for traffic modelling and behaviour analysis.</p></details> |  |

Existing datasets, focused on detection and localization, lack the annotations required for this legal reasoning. To bridge this gap, we introduce the \textbf{C}hinese \textbf{A}ccident \textbf{D}uty-determination \textbf{D}ataset (\textbf{CADD}), the first benchmark for statute-based liability attribution. CADD contains 792 real-world driving recorder videos, each annotated within a novel \textbf{``Behavior--Liability--Statute''} pipeline. This framework provides \textbf{granular, symmetric behavior annotations}, clear responsibility assignments, and, uniquely, links each case to the specific \textbf{Chinese traffic law statute} violated. We demonstrate the utility of CADD through detailed analysis and establish benchmarks for liability prediction and explainable decision-making. By directly connecting perceptual data to legal consequences, CADD provides a foundational resource for developing accountable and legally-grounded autonomous systems.</p></details> |  |

An Extensive Approach Considering Statistical, Machine Learning and Deep Learning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09450v1)** | 2025-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With rapid urbanization in recent decades, traffic congestion has intensified due to increased movement of people and goods. As planning shifts from demand-based to supply-oriented strategies, Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) have become essential for managing traffic within existing infrastructure. A core ITS function is traffic forecasting, enabling proactive measures like ramp metering, signal control, and dynamic routing through platforms such as Google Maps. This study assesses the performance of statistical, machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) models in forecasting traffic speed and flow using real-world data from California's Harbor Freeway, sourced from the Caltrans Performance Measurement System (PeMS). Each model was evaluated over 20 forecasting windows (up to 1 hour 40 minutes) using RMSE, MAE, and R-Square metrics. Results show ANFIS-GP performs best at early windows with RMSE of 0.038, MAE of 0.0276, and R-Square of 0.9983, while Bi-LSTM is more robust for medium-term prediction due to its capacity to model long-range temporal dependencies, achieving RMSE of 0.1863, MAE of 0.0833, and R-Square of 0.987 at a forecasting of 20. The degradation in model performance was quantified using logarithmic transformation, with slope values used to measure robustness. Among DL models, Bi-LSTM had the flattest slope (0.0454 RMSE, 0.0545 MAE for flow), whereas ANFIS-GP had 0.1058 for RMSE and 0.1037 for flow MAE. The study concludes by identifying hybrid models as a promising future direction.</p></details> | <details><summary>6,227...</summary><p>6,227 words text + 2*250 (2 tables) = 6,727 words</p></details> |

| **[Spatio-Temporal Data Enhanced Vision-Language Model for Traffic Scene Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08978v1)** | 2025-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Nowadays, navigation and ride-sharing apps have collected numerous images with spatio-temporal data. A core technology for analyzing such images, associated with spatiotemporal information, is Traffic Scene Understanding (TSU), which aims to provide a comprehensive description of the traffic scene. Unlike traditional spatio-temporal data analysis tasks, the dependence on both spatio-temporal and visual-textual data introduces distinct challenges to TSU task. However, recent research often treats TSU as a common image understanding task, ignoring the spatio-temporal information and overlooking the interrelations between different aspects of the traffic scene. To address these issues, we propose a novel SpatioTemporal Enhanced Model based on CILP (ST-CLIP) for TSU. Our model uses the classic vision-language model, CLIP, as the backbone, and designs a Spatio-temporal Context Aware Multiaspect Prompt (SCAMP) learning method to incorporate spatiotemporal information into TSU. The prompt learning method consists of two components: A dynamic spatio-temporal context representation module that extracts representation vectors of spatio-temporal data for each traffic scene image, and a bi-level ST-aware multi-aspect prompt learning module that integrates the ST-context representation vectors into word embeddings of prompts for the CLIP model. The second module also extracts low-level visual features and image-wise high-level semantic features to exploit interactive relations among different aspects of traffic scenes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to integrate spatio-temporal information into visionlanguage models to facilitate TSU task. Experiments on two realworld datasets demonstrate superior performance in the complex scene understanding scenarios with a few-shot learning strategy.</p></details> |  |

These limitations pose significant challenges for the efficient deployment and operation of deep learning models on large-scale datasets. To address these challenges, we propose a cost-effective graph-free Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) based model M3-Net for traffic prediction. Our proposed model not only employs time series and spatio-temporal embeddings for efficient feature processing but also first introduces a novel MLP-Mixer architecture with a mixture of experts (MoE) mechanism. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple real datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model in terms of prediction performance and lightweight deployment.Our code is available at https://github.com/jinguangyin/M3_NET</p></details> |  |

The importance of transportation networks and ITS for modern mobility and commerce necessitates forecasting models that are not only accurate but also interpretable, efficient, and robust under structural or temporal perturbations. Recent approaches, particularly Transformer-based architectures, have improved predictive performance but often at the cost of high computational overhead and diminished architectural interpretability. In this work, we introduce Weaver, a novel attention-based model that applies Kronecker product approximations (KPA) to decompose the PN X PN spatiotemporal attention of O(P^2N^2) complexity into local P X P temporal and N X N spatial attention maps. This Kronecker attention map enables our Parallel-Kronecker Matrix-Vector product (P2-KMV) for efficient spatiotemporal message passing with O(P^2N + N^2P) complexity. To capture real-world traffic dynamics, we address the importance of negative edges in modeling traffic behavior by introducing Valence Attention using the continuous Tanimoto coefficient (CTC), which provides properties conducive to precise latent graph generation and training stability. To fully utilize the model's learning capacity, we introduce the Traffic Phase Dictionary for self-conditioning. Evaluations on PEMS-BAY and METR-LA show that Weaver achieves competitive performance across model categories while training more efficiently.</p></details> |  |

Macroscopic emission fundamental diagram (eMFD)captures an orderly relationship among emission and aggregated traffic variables at the network level, allowing for real-time monitoring of region-wide emissions and optimal allocation of travel demand to existing networks, reducing urban congestion and associated emissions. However, empirically derived eMFD models are sparse due to historical data limitation. Leveraging a large-scale and granular traffic and emission data derived from probe vehicles, this study is the first to apply machine learning methods to predict the network wide emission rate to traffic relationship in U.S. urban areas at a large scale. The analysis framework and insights developed in this work generate data-driven eMFDs and a deeper understanding of their location dependence on network, infrastructure, land use, and vehicle characteristics, enabling transportation authorities to measure carbon emissions from urban transport of given travel demand and optimize location specific traffic management and planning decisions to mitigate network-wide emissions.</p></details> | <details><summary>3 pag...</summary><p>3 pages, 5 figures, IEEE Big Data 2024 conference</p></details> |

However, it can be difficult to accurately represent the complex traffic patterns of an attack, especially in Internet-of-Things (IoT) networks. This paper studies the impact that seemingly similar features created by different network traffic flow exporters can have on the generalization and robustness of ML models. In addition to the original CSV files of the Bot-IoT, IoT-23, and CICIoT23 datasets, the raw network packets of their PCAP files were analysed with the HERA tool, generating new labelled flows and extracting consistent features for new CSV versions. To assess the usefulness of these new flows for intrusion detection, they were compared with the original versions and were used to fine-tune multiple models. Overall, the results indicate that directly analysing and preprocessing PCAP files, instead of just using the commonly available CSV files, enables the computation of more relevant features to train bagging and gradient boosting decision tree ensembles. It is important to continue improving feature extraction and feature selection processes to make different datasets more compatible and enable a trustworthy evaluation and comparison of the ML models used in cybersecurity solutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 12 tables, 1 figure, FPS 2025 conference</p></details> |

The problem is complex due to the intricate spatial and temporal interdependence among regions. Prior works study the spatial and temporal dependency in a decouple manner, failing to capture their joint effect. In this work, we propose ST-SAM, a novel and efficient Spatial-Temporal Self-Attention Model for traffic forecasting. ST-SAM uses a region embedding layer to learn time-specific embedding from traffic data for regions. Then, it employs a spatial-temporal dependency learning module based on self-attention mechanism to capture the joint spatial-temporal dependency for both nearby and faraway regions. ST-SAM entirely relies on self-attention to capture both local and global spatial-temporal correlations, which make it effective and efficient. Extensive experiments on two real world datasets show that ST-SAM is substantially more accurate and efficient than the state-of-the-art approaches (with an average improvement of up to 15% on RMSE, 17% on MAPE, and 32 times on training time in our experiments).</p></details> | 5 pages |

In our approach, each robot autonomously plans its path and shares this information with a centralized node. The centralized system detects potential conflicts and allows only one of the conflicting robots to proceed at a time, instructing others to stop outside the conflicting area to avoid deadlocks. Unlike traditional centralized planning methods, our system does not dictate robot paths but instead provides stop commands, functioning as a virtual traffic light. In simulation experiments with multiple robots, our approach increased the success rate of robots reaching their goals while reducing deadlocks. Furthermore, we successfully validated the system in real-world experiments with two quadruped robots and separately with wheeled Duckiebots.</p></details> |  |

Existing machine learning (ML)-based approaches, typically trained on static single-domain datasets, often fail to generalize across heterogeneous network environments. To address this gap, we develop a realistic Docker-NS3-based testbed that emulates both IoT and traditional traffic conditions, enabling the generation and capture of live, labeled network flows. The resulting M-En Dataset combines this traffic with curated public PCAP traces to provide comprehensive coverage of benign and malicious behaviors. Building on this foundation, we propose Multi-LF, a real-time continuous learning framework that combines a lightweight model (M1) for rapid detection with a deeper model (M2) for high-confidence refinement and adaptation. A confidence-based coordination mechanism enhances efficiency without compromising accuracy, while weight interpolation mitigates catastrophic forgetting during continuous updates. Features extracted at 1-second intervals capture fine-grained temporal patterns, enabling early recognition of evolving attack behaviors. Implemented and evaluated within the Docker-NS3 testbed on live traffic, Multi-LF achieves an accuracy of 0.999 while requiring human intervention for only 0.0026 percent of packets, demonstrating its effectiveness and practicality for real-time malicious traffic detection in heterogeneous network environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This version (v2) corresponds to the revised manuscript submitted to the Journal of Network and Computer Applications (Elsevier).

Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), often modeling each traffic signal as an independent agent using Q-learning, has emerged as a promising strategy to reduce average commuter delays. While prior work Prashant L A et. al has empirically demonstrated the effectiveness of this approach, a rigorous theoretical analysis of its stability and convergence properties in the context of traffic control has not been explored. This paper bridges that gap by focusing squarely on the theoretical basis of this multi-agent algorithm. We investigate the convergence problem inherent in using independent learners for the cooperative TSC task. Utilizing stochastic approximation methods, we formally analyze the learning dynamics. The primary contribution of this work is the proof that the specific multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm for traffic control is proven to converge under the given conditions extending it from single agent convergence proofs for asynchronous value iteration.</p></details> | 14 pages 2 figures |
| **[On the Redundant Distributed Observability of Mixed Traffic Transportation Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06950v1)** | 2025-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, the problem of distributed state estimation of human-driven vehicles (HDVs) by connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) is investigated in mixed traffic transportation systems. Toward this, a distributed observable state-space model is derived, which paves the way for estimation and observability analysis of HDVs in mixed traffic scenarios. In this direction, first, we obtain the condition on the network topology to satisfy the distributed observability, i.e., the condition such that each HDV state is observable to every CAV via information-exchange over the network. It is shown that strong connectivity of the network, along with the proper design of the observer gain, is sufficient for this. A distributed observer is then designed by locally sharing estimates/observations of each CAV with its neighborhood. Second, in case there exist faulty sensors or unreliable observation data, we derive the condition for redundant distributed observability as a $q$-node/link-connected network design. This redundancy is achieved by extra information-sharing over the network and implies that a certain number of faulty sensors and unreliable links can be isolated/removed without losing the observability. Simulation results are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>EURAS...</summary><p>EURASIP journal on advances in signal processing</p></details> |

FedNET employs Federated Learning (FL) to model the temporal evolution of node-level traffic in a distributed manner, enabling accurate multi-step-ahead predictions (e.g., several hours to days) without exposing sensitive network data. Using these node-level forecasts and known routing information, FedNET estimates the future link-level utilization by aggregating traffic contributions across all source-destination pairs. The links are then ranked according to the predicted load intensity and temporal variability, providing an early warning signal for potential high-risk links. We compare the federated traffic prediction of FedNET against a centralized multi-step learning baseline and then systematically analyze the impact of history and prediction window sizes on forecast accuracy using the $R^2$ score. Results indicate that FL achieves accuracy close to centralized training, with shorter prediction horizons consistently yielding the highest accuracy ($R^2 >0.92$), while longer horizons providing meaningful forecasts ($R^2 \approx 0.45\text{--}0.55$). We further validate the efficacy of the FedNET framework in predicting network utilization on a realistic network topology and demonstrate that it consistently identifies high-risk links well in advance (i.e., three days ahead) of the critical stress states emerging, making it a practical tool for anticipatory traffic engineering and capacity planning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Automated Vehicles at Unsignalized Intersections: Safety and Efficiency Implications of Mixed Human and Automated Traffic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12538v3)** | 2025-11-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of automated vehicles (AVs) into transportation systems presents an unprecedented opportunity to enhance road safety and efficiency. However, understanding the interactions between AVs and human-driven vehicles (HVs) at intersections remains an open research question. This study aims to bridge this gap by examining behavioral differences and adaptations of AVs and HVs at unsignalized intersections by utilizing two large-scale AV datasets from Waymo and Lyft. By using a systematic methodology, the research identifies and analyzes merging and crossing conflicts by calculating key safety and efficiency metrics, including time to collision (TTC), post-encroachment time (PET), maximum required deceleration (MRD), time advantage (TA), and speed and acceleration profiles. Through this approach, the study assesses the safety and efficiency implications of these behavioral differences and adaptations for mixed-autonomy traffic. The findings reveal a paradox: while AVs maintain larger safety margins, their conservative behavior can lead to unexpected situations for human drivers, potentially causing unsafe conditions. From a performance point of view, human drivers tend to exhibit more consistent behavior when interacting with AVs versus other HVs, suggesting AVs may contribute to harmonizing traffic flow patterns. Moreover, notable differences were observed between Waymo and Lyft vehicles, which highlights the importance of considering manufacturer-specific AV behaviors in traffic modeling and management strategies for the safe integration of AVs. The processed dataset, as well as the developed algorithms and scripts, are openly published to foster research on AV-HV interactions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published OnlineFirst in Transportation Research Record (TRR), DOI: 10.1177/03611981251370343</p></details> |
| **[Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning for Fair and Efficient Urban Traffic Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06363v1)** | 2025-11-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The optimization of urban traffic is threatened by the complexity of achieving a balance between transport efficiency and the maintenance of privacy, as well as the equitable distribution of traffic based on socioeconomically diverse neighborhoods. Current centralized traffic management schemes invade user location privacy and further entrench traffic disparity by offering disadvantaged route suggestions, whereas current federated learning frameworks do not consider fairness constraints in multi-objective traffic settings. This study presents a privacy-preserving federated learning framework, termed FedFair-Traffic, that jointly and simultaneously optimizes travel efficiency, traffic fairness, and differential privacy protection. This is the first attempt to integrate three conflicting objectives to improve urban transportation systems. The proposed methodology enables collaborative learning between related vehicles with data locality by integrating Graph Neural Networks with differential privacy mechanisms ($ε$-privacy guarantees) and Gini coefficient-based fair constraints using multi-objective optimization. The framework uses federated aggregation methods of gradient clipping and noise injection to provide differential privacy and optimize Pareto-efficient solutions for the efficiency-fairness tradeoff. Real-world comprehensive experiments on the METR-LA traffic dataset showed that FedFair-Traffic can reduce the average travel time by 7\% (14.2 minutes) compared with their centralized baselines, promote traffic fairness by 73\% (Gini coefficient, 0.78), and offer high privacy protection (privacy score, 0.8) with an 89\% reduction in communication overhead. These outcomes demonstrate that FedFair-Traffic is a scalable privacy-aware smart city infrastructure with possible use-cases in metropolitan traffic flow control and federated transportation networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review at IEEE journal</p></details> |
| **[LLM-Guided Reinforcement Learning with Representative Agents for Traffic Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06260v1)** | 2025-11-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as behavioral proxies for self-interested travelers in agent-based traffic models. Although more flexible and generalizable than conventional models, the practical use of these approaches remains limited by scalability due to the cost of calling one LLM for every traveler. Moreover, it has been found that LLM agents often make opaque choices and produce unstable day-to-day dynamics. To address these challenges, we propose to model each homogeneous traveler group facing the same decision context with a single representative LLM agent who behaves like the population's average, maintaining and updating a mixed strategy over routes that coincides with the group's aggregate flow proportions. Each day, the LLM reviews the travel experience and flags routes with positive reinforcement that they hope to use more often, and an interpretable update rule then converts this judgment into strategy adjustments using a tunable (progressively decaying) step size. The representative-agent design improves scalability, while the separation of reasoning from updating clarifies the decision logic while stabilizing learning. In classic traffic assignment settings, we find that the proposed approach converges rapidly to the user equilibrium. In richer settings with income heterogeneity, multi-criteria costs, and multi-modal choices, the generated dynamics remain stable and interpretable, reproducing plausible behavioral patterns well-documented in psychology and economics, for example, the decoy effect in toll versus non-toll road selection, and higher willingness-to-pay for convenience among higher-income travelers when choosing between driving, transit, and park-and-ride options.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep Reinforcement Learning for Dynamic Origin-Destination Matrix Estimation in Microscopic Traffic Simulations Considering Credit Assignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06229v1)** | 2025-11-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper focuses on dynamic origin-destination matrix estimation (DODE), a crucial calibration process necessary for the effective application of microscopic traffic simulations. The fundamental challenge of the DODE problem in microscopic simulations stems from the complex temporal dynamics and inherent uncertainty of individual vehicle dynamics. This makes it highly challenging to precisely determine which vehicle traverses which link at any given moment, resulting in intricate and often ambiguous relationships between origin-destination (OD) matrices and their contributions to resultant link flows. This phenomenon constitutes the credit assignment problem, a central challenge addressed in this study. We formulate the DODE problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and propose a novel framework that applies model-free deep reinforcement learning (DRL). Within our proposed framework, the agent learns an optimal policy to sequentially generate OD matrices, refining its strategy through direct interaction with the simulation environment. The proposed method is validated on the Nguyen-Dupuis network using SUMO, where its performance is evaluated against ground-truth link flows aggregated at 5-minute intervals over a 30-minute horizon. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves a 43.2% reduction in mean squared error (MSE) compared to the best-performing conventional baseline. By reframing DODE as a sequential decision-making problem, our approach addresses the credit assignment challenge through its learned policy, thereby overcoming the limitations of conventional methods and proposing a novel framework for calibration of microscopic traffic simulations.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 10 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[SymLight: Exploring Interpretable and Deployable Symbolic Policies for Traffic Signal Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05790v1)** | 2025-11-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep Reinforcement Learning have achieved significant success in automatically devising effective traffic signal control (TSC) policies. Neural policies, however, tend to be over-parameterized and non-transparent, hindering their interpretability and deployability on resource-limited edge devices. This work presents SymLight, a priority function search framework based on Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for discovering inherently interpretable and deployable symbolic priority functions to serve as the TSC policies. The priority function, in particular, accepts traffic features as input and then outputs a priority for each traffic signal phase, which subsequently directs the phase transition. For effective search, we propose a concise yet expressive priority function representation. This helps mitigate the combinatorial explosion of the action space in MCTS. Additionally, a probabilistic structural rollout strategy is introduced to leverage structural patterns from previously discovered high-quality priority functions, guiding the rollout process. Our experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate SymLight's superior performance across a range of baselines. A key advantage is SymLight's ability to produce interpretable and deployable TSC policies while maintaining excellent performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[BLADE: Behavior-Level Anomaly Detection Using Network Traffic in Web Services](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05193v1)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With their widespread popularity, web services have become the main targets of various cyberattacks. Existing traffic anomaly detection approaches focus on flow-level attacks, yet fail to recognize behavior-level attacks, which appear benign in individual flows but reveal malicious purpose using multiple network flows. To transcend this limitation, we propose a novel unsupervised traffic anomaly detection system, BLADE, capable of detecting not only flow-level but also behavior-level attacks in web services. Our key observation is that application-layer operations of web services exhibit distinctive communication patterns at the network layer from a multi-flow perspective. BLADE first exploits a flow autoencoder to learn a latent feature representation and calculates its reconstruction losses per flow. Then, the latent representation is assigned a pseudo operation label using an unsupervised clustering method. Next, an anomaly score is computed based on the reconstruction losses. Finally, the triplets of timestamps, pseudo labels, and anomaly scores from multiple flows are aggregated and fed into a one-class classifier to characterize the behavior patterns of legitimate web operations, enabling the detection of flow-level and behavior-level anomalies. BLADE is extensively evaluated on both the custom dataset and the CIC-IDS2017 dataset. The experimental results demonstrate BLADE's superior performance, achieving high F1 scores of 0.9732 and 0.9801, respectively, on the two datasets, and outperforming traditional single-flow anomaly detection baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE MSN 2025</p></details> |
| **[Self-Interest and Systemic Benefits: Emergence of Collective Rationality in Mixed Autonomy Traffic Through Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04883v1)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are expected to be commercially available in the near future, leading to mixed autonomy traffic consisting of both AVs and human-driven vehicles (HVs). Although numerous studies have shown that AVs can be deployed to benefit the overall traffic system performance by incorporating system-level goals into their decision making, it is not clear whether the benefits still exist when agents act out of self-interest -- a trait common to all driving agents, both human and autonomous. This study aims to understand whether self-interested AVs can bring benefits to all driving agents in mixed autonomy traffic systems. The research is centered on the concept of collective rationality (CR). This concept, originating from game theory and behavioral economics, means that driving agents may cooperate collectively even when pursuing individual interests. Our recent research has proven the existence of CR in an analytical game-theoretical model and empirically in mixed human-driven traffic. In this paper, we demonstrate that CR can be attained among driving agents trained using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) with a simple reward design. We examine the extent to which self-interested traffic agents can achieve CR without directly incorporating system-level objectives. Results show that CR consistently emerges in various scenarios, which indicates the robustness of this property. We also postulate a mechanism to explain the emergence of CR in the microscopic and dynamic environment and verify it based on simulation evidence. This research suggests the possibility of leveraging advanced learning methods (such as federated learning) to achieve collective cooperation among self-interested driving agents in mixed-autonomy systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Smartphone User Fingerprinting on Wireless Traffic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03229v1)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to the openness of the wireless medium, smartphone users are susceptible to user privacy attacks, where user privacy information is inferred from encrypted Wi-Fi wireless traffic. Existing attacks are limited to recognizing mobile apps and their actions and cannot infer the smartphone user identity, a fundamental part of user privacy. To overcome this limitation, we propose U-Print, a novel attack system that can passively recognize smartphone apps, actions, and users from over-the-air MAC-layer frames. We observe that smartphone users usually prefer different add-on apps and in-app actions, yielding different changing patterns in Wi-Fi traffic. U-Print first extracts multi-level traffic features and exploits customized temporal convolutional networks to recognize smartphone apps and actions, thus producing users' behavior sequences. Then, it leverages the silhouette coefficient method to determine the number of users and applies the k-means clustering to profile and identify smartphone users. We implement U-Print using a laptop with a Kali dual-band wireless network card and evaluate it in three real-world environments. U-Print achieves an overall accuracy of 98.4% and an F1 score of 0.983 for user inference. Moreover, it can correctly recognize up to 96% of apps and actions in the closed world and more than 86% in the open world.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2408.07263</p></details> |
| **[Modeling Headway in Heterogeneous and Mixed Traffic Flow: A Statistical Distribution Based on a General Exponential Function](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03154v1)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ability of existing headway distributions to accurately reflect the diverse behaviors and characteristics in heterogeneous traffic (different types of vehicles) and mixed traffic (human-driven vehicles with autonomous vehicles) is limited, leading to unsatisfactory goodness of fit. To address these issues, we modified the exponential function to obtain a novel headway distribution. Rather than employing Euler's number (e) as the base of the exponential function, we utilized a real number base to provide greater flexibility in modeling the observed headway. However, the proposed is not a probability function. We normalize it to calculate the probability and derive the closed-form equation. In this study, we utilized a comprehensive experiment with five open datasets: highD, exiD, NGSIM, Waymo, and Lyft to evaluate the performance of the proposed distribution and compared its performance with six existing distributions under mixed and heterogeneous traffic flow. The results revealed that the proposed distribution not only captures the fundamental characteristics of headway distribution but also provides physically meaningful parameters that describe the distribution shape of observed headways. Under heterogeneous flow on highways (i.e., uninterrupted traffic flow), the proposed distribution outperforms other candidate distributions. Under urban road conditions (i.e., interrupted traffic flow), including heterogeneous and mixed traffic, the proposed distribution still achieves decent results.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Urban Vision Hackathon Dataset and Models: Towards Image Annotations and Accurate Vision Models for Indian Traffic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02563v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This report describes the UVH-26 dataset, the first public release by AIM@IISc of a large-scale dataset of annotated traffic-camera images from India. The dataset comprises 26,646 high-resolution (1080p) images sampled from 2800 Bengaluru's Safe-City CCTV cameras over a 4-week period, and subsequently annotated through a crowdsourced hackathon involving 565 college students from across India. In total, 1.8 million bounding boxes were labeled across 14 vehicle classes specific to India: Cycle, 2-Wheeler (Motorcycle), 3-Wheeler (Auto-rickshaw), LCV (Light Commercial Vehicles), Van, Tempo-traveller, Hatchback, Sedan, SUV, MUV, Mini-bus, Bus, Truck and Other. Of these, 283k-316k consensus ground truth bounding boxes and labels were derived for distinct objects in the 26k images using Majority Voting and STAPLE algorithms. Further, we train multiple contemporary detectors, including YOLO11-S/X, RT-DETR-S/X, and DAMO-YOLO-T/L using these datasets, and report accuracy based on mAP50, mAP75 and mAP50:95. Models trained on UVH-26 achieve 8.4-31.5% improvements in mAP50:95 over equivalent baseline models trained on COCO dataset, with RT-DETR-X showing the best performance at 0.67 (mAP50:95) as compared to 0.40 for COCO-trained weights for common classes (Car, Bus, and Truck). This demonstrates the benefits of domain-specific training data for Indian traffic scenarios. The release package provides the 26k images with consensus annotations based on Majority Voting (UVH-26-MV) and STAPLE (UVH-26-ST) and the 6 fine-tuned YOLO and DETR models on each of these datasets. By capturing the heterogeneity of Indian urban mobility directly from operational traffic-camera streams, UVH-26 addresses a critical gap in existing global benchmarks, and offers a foundation for advancing detection, classification, and deployment of intelligent transportation systems in emerging nations with complex traffic conditions.</p></details> |  |

| **[Adv-BMT: Bidirectional Motion Transformer for Safety-Critical Traffic Scenario Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09485v2)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scenario-based testing is essential for validating the performance of autonomous driving (AD) systems. However, such testing is limited by the scarcity of long-tailed, safety-critical scenarios in existing datasets collected in the real world. To tackle the data issue, we propose the Adv-BMT framework, which augments real-world scenarios with diverse and realistic adversarial traffic interactions. The core component of Adv-BMT is a bidirectional motion transformer (BMT) model to perform inverse traffic motion predictions, which takes agent information in the last time step of the scenario as input, and reconstructs the traffic in the inverse of chronological order until the initial time step. The Adv-BMT framework is a two-staged pipeline: it first conducts adversarial initializations and then inverse motion predictions. Different from previous work, we do not need any collision data for pretraining, and are able to generate realistic and diverse collision interactions. Our experimental results validate the quality of generated collision scenarios by Adv-BMT: training in our augmented dataset would reduce episode collision rates by 20%. Demo and code are available at: https://metadriverse.github.io/adv-bmt/.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Spatio-Temporal Online Robust Tensor Recovery Approach for Streaming Traffic Data Imputation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01267v1)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data quality is critical to Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), as complete and accurate traffic data underpin reliable decision-making in traffic control and management. Recent advances in low-rank tensor recovery algorithms have shown strong potential in capturing the inherent structure of high-dimensional traffic data and restoring degraded observations. However, traditional batch-based methods demand substantial computational and storage resources, which limits their scalability in the face of continuously expanding traffic data volumes. Moreover, recent online tensor recovery methods often suffer from severe performance degradation in complex real-world scenarios due to their insufficient exploitation of the intrinsic structural properties of traffic data. To address these challenges, we reformulate the traffic data recovery problem within a streaming framework, and propose a novel online robust tensor recovery algorithm that simultaneously leverages both the global spatio-temporal correlations and local consistency of traffic data, achieving high recovery accuracy and significantly improved computational efficiency in large-scale scenarios. Our method is capable of simultaneously handling missing and anomalous values in traffic data, and demonstrates strong adaptability across diverse missing patterns. Experimental results on three real-world traffic datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves high recovery accuracy while significantly improving computational efficiency by up to three orders of magnitude compared to state-of-the-art batch-based methods. These findings highlight the potential of the proposed approach as a scalable and effective solution for traffic data quality enhancement in ITS.</p></details> |  |
| **[Single-agent Reinforcement Learning Model for Regional Adaptive Traffic Signal Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00551v1)** | 2025-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Several studies have employed reinforcement learning (RL) to address the challenges of regional adaptive traffic signal control (ATSC) and achieved promising results. In this field, existing research predominantly adopts multi-agent frameworks. However, the adoption of multi-agent frameworks presents challenges for scalability. Instead, the Traffic signal control (TSC) problem necessitates a single-agent framework. TSC inherently relies on centralized management by a single control center, which can monitor traffic conditions across all roads in the study area and coordinate the control of all intersections. This work proposes a single-agent RL-based regional ATSC model compatible with probe vehicle technology. Key components of the RL design include state, action, and reward function definitions. To facilitate learning and manage congestion, both state and reward functions are defined based on queue length, with action designed to regulate queue dynamics. The queue length definition used in this study differs slightly from conventional definitions but is closely correlated with congestion states. More importantly, it allows for reliable estimation using link travel time data from probe vehicles. With probe vehicle data already covering most urban roads, this feature enhances the proposed method's potential for widespread deployment. The method was comprehensively evaluated using the SUMO simulation platform. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model effectively mitigates large-scale regional congestion levels via coordinated multi-intersection control.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust Single-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Regional Traffic Signal Control Under Demand Fluctuations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00549v1)** | 2025-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic congestion, primarily driven by intersection queuing, significantly impacts urban living standards, safety, environmental quality, and economic efficiency. While Traffic Signal Control (TSC) systems hold potential for congestion mitigation, traditional optimization models often fail to capture real-world traffic complexity and dynamics. This study introduces a novel single-agent reinforcement learning (RL) framework for regional adaptive TSC, circumventing the coordination complexities inherent in multi-agent systems through a centralized decision-making paradigm. The model employs an adjacency matrix to unify the encoding of road network topology, real-time queue states derived from probe vehicle data, and current signal timing parameters. Leveraging the efficient learning capabilities of the DreamerV3 world model, the agent learns control policies where actions sequentially select intersections and adjust their signal phase splits to regulate traffic inflow/outflow, analogous to a feedback control system. Reward design prioritizes queue dissipation, directly linking congestion metrics (queue length) to control actions. Simulation experiments conducted in SUMO demonstrate the model's effectiveness: under inference scenarios with multi-level (10%, 20%, 30%) Origin-Destination (OD) demand fluctuations, the framework exhibits robust anti-fluctuation capability and significantly reduces queue lengths. This work establishes a new paradigm for intelligent traffic control compatible with probe vehicle technology. Future research will focus on enhancing practical applicability by incorporating stochastic OD demand fluctuations during training and exploring regional optimization mechanisms for contingency events.</p></details> |  |
| **[Information-Theoretic Greedy Layer-wise Training for Traffic Sign Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27651v1)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern deep neural networks (DNNs) are typically trained with a global cross-entropy loss in a supervised end-to-end manner: neurons need to store their outgoing weights; training alternates between a forward pass (computation) and a top-down backward pass (learning) which is biologically implausible. Alternatively, greedy layer-wise training eliminates the need for cross-entropy loss and backpropagation. By avoiding the computation of intermediate gradients and the storage of intermediate outputs, it reduces memory usage and helps mitigate issues such as vanishing or exploding gradients. However, most existing layer-wise training approaches have been evaluated only on relatively small datasets with simple deep architectures. In this paper, we first systematically analyze the training dynamics of popular convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained by stochastic gradient descent (SGD) through an information-theoretic lens. Our findings reveal that networks converge layer-by-layer from bottom to top and that the flow of information adheres to a Markov information bottleneck principle. Building on these observations, we propose a novel layer-wise training approach based on the recently developed deterministic information bottleneck (DIB) and the matrix-based Rényi's $α$-order entropy functional. Specifically, each layer is trained jointly with an auxiliary classifier that connects directly to the output layer, enabling the learning of minimal sufficient task-relevant representations. We empirically validate the effectiveness of our training procedure on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 using modern deep CNNs and further demonstrate its applicability to a practical task involving traffic sign recognition. Our approach not only outperforms existing layer-wise training baselines but also achieves performance comparable to SGD.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Dual Large Language Models Architecture with Herald Guided Prompts for Parallel Fine Grained Traffic Signal Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00136v1)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Leveraging large language models (LLMs) in traffic signal control (TSC) improves optimization efficiency and interpretability compared to traditional reinforcement learning (RL) methods. However, existing LLM-based approaches are limited by fixed time signal durations and are prone to hallucination errors, while RL methods lack robustness in signal timing decisions and suffer from poor generalization. To address these challenges, this paper proposes HeraldLight, a dual LLMs architecture enhanced by Herald guided prompts. The Herald Module extracts contextual information and forecasts queue lengths for each traffic phase based on real-time conditions. The first LLM, LLM-Agent, uses these forecasts to make fine grained traffic signal control, while the second LLM, LLM-Critic, refines LLM-Agent's outputs, correcting errors and hallucinations. These refined outputs are used for score-based fine-tuning to improve accuracy and robustness. Simulation experiments using CityFlow on real world datasets covering 224 intersections in Jinan (12), Hangzhou (16), and New York (196) demonstrate that HeraldLight outperforms state of the art baselines, achieving a 20.03% reduction in average travel time across all scenarios and a 10.74% reduction in average queue length on the Jinan and Hangzhou scenarios.

Traditional batch learning models face challenges such as high maintenance and poor adaptability to rapid anomaly changes, known as concept drift. In contrast, streaming learning integrates online and incremental learning, enabling seamless updates and concept drift detection to improve robustness. This study investigates anomaly detection in streaming IoT traffic as binary classification, comparing batch and streaming learning approaches while assessing the limitations of current IoT traffic datasets. We simulated heterogeneous network data streams by carefully mixing existing datasets and streaming the samples one by one. Our results highlight the failure of batch models to handle concept drift, but also reveal persisting limitations of current datasets to expose model limitations due to low traffic heterogeneity. We also investigated the competitiveness of tree-based ML algorithms, well-known in batch anomaly detection, and compared it to non-tree-based ones, confirming the advantages of the former. Adaptive Random Forest achieved F1-score of 0.990 $\pm$ 0.006 at one-third the computational cost of its batch counterpart. Hoeffding Adaptive Tree reached F1-score of 0.910 $\pm$ 0.007, reducing computational cost by four times, making it a viable choice for online applications despite a slight trade-off in stability.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 11 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

Traditional accident prediction models treat road segments independently, failing to capture complex spatial relationships and temporal dependencies in urban transportation networks. This study develops MDAS-GNN, a Multi-Dimensional Attention-based Spatial-diffusion Graph Neural Network integrating three core risk dimensions: traffic safety, infrastructure, and environmental risk. The framework employs feature-specific spatial diffusion mechanisms and multi-head temporal attention to capture dependencies across different time horizons. Evaluated on UK Department for Transport accident data across Central London, South Manchester, and SE Birmingham, MDASGNN achieves superior performance compared to established baseline methods. The model maintains consistently low prediction errors across short, medium, and long-term periods, with particular strength in long-term forecasting. Ablation studies confirm that integrated multi-dimensional features outperform singlefeature approaches, reducing prediction errors by up to 40%. This framework provides civil engineers and urban planners with advanced predictive capabilities for transportation infrastructure design, enabling data-driven decisions for road network optimization, infrastructure resource improvements, and strategic safety interventions in urban development projects.</p></details> |  |

However, existing MLLMs in this domain primarily focus on coarse-grained image-level or video-level comprehension and often struggle to handle fine-grained visual details or localized scene components, limiting their applicability in complex accident scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose SafePLUG, a novel framework that empowers MLLMs with both Pixel-Level Understanding and temporal Grounding for comprehensive traffic accident analysis. SafePLUG supports both arbitrary-shaped visual prompts for region-aware question answering and pixel-level segmentation based on language instructions, while also enabling the recognition of temporally anchored events in traffic accident scenarios.

| **[A Cloud-Based Spatio-Temporal GNN-Transformer Hybrid Model for Traffic Flow Forecasting with External Feature Integration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27039v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate traffic flow forecasting is essential for the development of intelligent transportation systems (ITS), supporting tasks such as traffic signal optimization, congestion management, and route planning. Traditional models often fail to effectively capture complex spatial-temporal dependencies in large-scale road networks, especially under the influence of external factors such as weather, holidays, and traffic accidents. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a cloud-based hybrid model that integrates Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (ST-GNN) with a Transformer architecture for traffic flow prediction. The model leverages the strengths of GNNs in modeling spatial correlations across road networks and the Transformers' ability to capture long-term temporal dependencies. External contextual features are incorporated via feature fusion to enhance predictive accuracy. The proposed model is deployed on a cloud computing platform to achieve scalability and real-time adaptability. Experimental evaluation of the dataset shows that our model outperforms baseline methods (LSTM, TCN, GCN, pure Transformer) with an RMSE of only 17.92 and a MAE of only 10.53. These findings suggest that the hybrid GNN-Transformer approach provides an effective and scalable solution for cloud-based ITS applications, offering methodological advancements for traffic flow forecasting and practical implications for congestion mitigation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Retrieval Augmented Generation-Enhanced Distributed LLM Agents for Generalizable Traffic Signal Control with Emergency Vehicles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26242v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With increasing urban traffic complexity, Traffic Signal Control (TSC) is essential for optimizing traffic flow and improving road safety. Large Language Models (LLMs) emerge as promising approaches for TSC. However, they are prone to hallucinations in emergencies, leading to unreliable decisions that may cause substantial delays for emergency vehicles. Moreover, diverse intersection types present substantial challenges for traffic state encoding and cross-intersection training, limiting generalization across heterogeneous intersections. Therefore, this paper proposes Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)-enhanced distributed LLM agents with Emergency response for Generalizable TSC (REG-TSC). Firstly, this paper presents an emergency-aware reasoning framework, which dynamically adjusts reasoning depth based on the emergency scenario and is equipped with a novel Reviewer-based Emergency RAG (RERAG) to distill specific knowledge and guidance from historical cases, enhancing the reliability and rationality of agents' emergency decisions. Secondly, this paper designs a type-agnostic traffic representation and proposes a Reward-guided Reinforced Refinement (R3) for heterogeneous intersections. R3 adaptively samples training experience from diverse intersections with environment feedback-based priority and fine-tunes LLM agents with a designed reward-weighted likelihood loss, guiding REG-TSC toward high-reward policies across heterogeneous intersections. On three real-world road networks with 17 to 177 heterogeneous intersections, extensive experiments show that REG-TSC reduces travel time by 42.00%, queue length by 62.31%, and emergency vehicle waiting time by 83.16%, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[DARTS: A Drone-Based AI-Powered Real-Time Traffic Incident Detection System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26004v1)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rapid and reliable incident detection is critical for reducing crash-related fatalities, injuries, and congestion. However, conventional methods, such as closed-circuit television, dashcam footage, and sensor-based detection, separate detection from verification, suffer from limited flexibility, and require dense infrastructure or high penetration rates, restricting adaptability and scalability to shifting incident hotspots. To overcome these challenges, we developed DARTS, a drone-based, AI-powered real-time traffic incident detection system. DARTS integrates drones' high mobility and aerial perspective for adaptive surveillance, thermal imaging for better low-visibility performance and privacy protection, and a lightweight deep learning framework for real-time vehicle trajectory extraction and incident detection. The system achieved 99% detection accuracy on a self-collected dataset and supports simultaneous online visual verification, severity assessment, and incident-induced congestion propagation monitoring via a web-based interface. In a field test on Interstate 75 in Florida, DARTS detected and verified a rear-end collision 12 minutes earlier than the local transportation management center and monitored incident-induced congestion propagation, suggesting potential to support faster emergency response and enable proactive traffic control to reduce congestion and secondary crash risk. Crucially, DARTS's flexible deployment architecture reduces dependence on frequent physical patrols, indicating potential scalability and cost-effectiveness for use in remote areas and resource-constrained settings. This study presents a promising step toward a more flexible and integrated real-time traffic incident detection system, with significant implications for the operational efficiency and responsiveness of modern transportation management.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint version.

| **[VISAT: Benchmarking Adversarial and Distribution Shift Robustness in Traffic Sign Recognition with Visual Attributes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26833v1)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present VISAT, a novel open dataset and benchmarking suite for evaluating model robustness in the task of traffic sign recognition with the presence of visual attributes. Built upon the Mapillary Traffic Sign Dataset (MTSD), our dataset introduces two benchmarks that respectively emphasize robustness against adversarial attacks and distribution shifts. For our adversarial attack benchmark, we employ the state-of-the-art Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) method to generate adversarial inputs and evaluate their impact on popular models. Additionally, we investigate the effect of adversarial attacks on attribute-specific multi-task learning (MTL) networks, revealing spurious correlations among MTL tasks. The MTL networks leverage visual attributes (color, shape, symbol, and text) that we have created for each traffic sign in our dataset. For our distribution shift benchmark, we utilize ImageNet-C's realistic data corruption and natural variation techniques to perform evaluations on the robustness of both base and MTL models. Moreover, we further explore spurious correlations among MTL tasks through synthetic alterations of traffic sign colors using color quantization techniques. Our experiments focus on two major backbones, ResNet-152 and ViT-B/32, and compare the performance between base and MTL models. The VISAT dataset and benchmarking framework contribute to the understanding of model robustness for traffic sign recognition, shedding light on the challenges posed by adversarial attacks and distribution shifts. We believe this work will facilitate advancements in developing more robust models for real-world applications in autonomous driving and cyber-physical systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adversarial Pre-Padding: Generating Evasive Network Traffic Against Transformer-Based Classifiers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25810v1)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To date, traffic obfuscation techniques have been widely adopted to protect network data privacy and security by obscuring the true patterns of traffic. Nevertheless, as the pre-trained models emerge, especially transformer-based classifiers, existing traffic obfuscation methods become increasingly vulnerable, as witnessed by current studies reporting the traffic classification accuracy up to 99\% or higher. To counter such high-performance transformer-based classification models, we in this paper propose a novel and effective \underline{adv}ersarial \underline{traffic}-generating approach (AdvTraffic\footnote{The code and data are available at: http://xxx}). Our approach has two key innovations: (i) a pre-padding strategy is proposed to modify packets, which effectively overcomes the limitations of existing research against transformer-based models for network traffic classification; and (ii) a reinforcement learning model is employed to optimize network traffic perturbations, aiming to maximize adversarial effectiveness against transformer-based classification models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to apply adversarial perturbation techniques to defend against transformer-based traffic classifiers. Furthermore, our method can be easily deployed into practical network environments. Finally, multi-faceted experiments are conducted across several real-world datasets, and the experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method can effectively undermine transformer-based classifiers, significantly reducing classification accuracy from 99\% to as low as 25.68\%.</p></details> |  |

Traffic was captured using Wireshark, and key metrics (including delay, jitter, bandwidth, and packet loss) were analyzed. Google Drive maintained the most consistent performance across both types of networks, showing low latency and reduced jitter. Dropbox showed efficient bandwidth utilization, but experienced a longer delay over LTE, attributed to a greater number of intermediate hops. OneDrive presented variable behavior, with elevated packet rates and increased sensitivity to fluctuations in the mobile network. A bimodal distribution of packet sizes was observed and modeled using a dual Poisson function. In general, Wi-Fi connections provided greater stability for multimedia transfers, while LTE performance varied depending on platform-specific implementations. The results contribute to a better understanding of traffic behavior in cloud-based storage applications and suggest further analysis with larger datasets and heterogeneous access networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>2025 ...</summary><p>2025 20th Iberian Conference on Information Systems and Technologies (CISTI), Lecture Notes in Networks and Systems</p></details> |

The dataset provides a unique view into global threat activity as observed through scanning and backscatter traffic, key indicators of large-scale probing behavior, data outages, and ongoing denial-of-service (DoS) campaigns. To process this extensive archive, coarse-to-fine methodology is adopted in which general insights are first extracted through a resource-efficient metadata sub-pipeline, followed by a more detailed packet header sub-pipeline for finer-grained analysis. The methodology establishes two sub-pipelines to enable scalable processing of nearly two decades of telescope data and supports multi-level exploration of traffic dynamics. Initial insights highlight long-term trends and recurring traffic spikes, some attributable to Internet-wide scanning events and others likely linked to DoS activities.We present general observations spanning 2006-2024, with a focused analysis of traffic characteristics during 2024.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pixels to Signals: A Real-Time Framework for Traffic Demand Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24902v1)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic congestion is becoming a challenge in the rapidly growing urban cities, resulting in increasing delays and inefficiencies within urban transportation systems. To address this issue a comprehensive methodology is designed to optimize traffic flow and minimize delays. The framework is structured with three primary components: (a) vehicle detection, (b) traffic prediction, and (c) traffic signal optimization. This paper presents the first component, vehicle detection. The methodology involves analyzing multiple sequential frames from a camera feed to compute the background, i.e. the underlying roadway, by averaging pixel values over time. The computed background is then utilized to extract the foreground, where the Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) algorithm is applied to detect vehicles. With its computational efficiency and minimal infrastructure modification requirements, the proposed methodology offers a practical and scalable solution for real-world deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Assessing the Completeness of Traffic Scenario Categories for Automated Highway Driving Functions via Cluster-based Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02599v2)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ability to operate safely in increasingly complex traffic scenarios is a fundamental requirement for Automated Driving Systems (ADS). Ensuring the safe release of ADS functions necessitates a precise understanding of the occurring traffic scenarios. To support this objective, this work introduces a pipeline for traffic scenario clustering and the analysis of scenario category completeness. The Clustering Vector Quantized - Variational Autoencoder (CVQ-VAE) is employed for the clustering of highway traffic scenarios and utilized to create various catalogs with differing numbers of traffic scenario categories. Subsequently, the impact of the number of categories on the completeness considerations of the traffic scenario categories is analyzed. The results show an outperforming clustering performance compared to previous work. The trade-off between cluster quality and the amount of required data to maintain completeness is discussed based on the publicly available highD dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[DQ3D: Depth-guided Query for Transformer-Based 3D Object Detection in Traffic Scenarios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23144v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D object detection from multi-view images in traffic scenarios has garnered significant attention in recent years. Many existing approaches rely on object queries that are generated from 3D reference points to localize objects. However, a limitation of these methods is that some reference points are often far from the target object, which can lead to false positive detections. In this paper, we propose a depth-guided query generator for 3D object detection (DQ3D) that leverages depth information and 2D detections to ensure that reference points are sampled from the surface or interior of the object. Furthermore, to address partially occluded objects in current frame, we introduce a hybrid attention mechanism that fuses historical detection results with depth-guided queries, thereby forming hybrid queries. Evaluation on the nuScenes dataset demonstrates that our method outperforms the baseline by 6.3\% in terms of mean Average Precision (mAP) and 4.3\% in the NuScenes Detection Score (NDS).</p></details> |  |
| **[Traffic flow forecasting, STL decomposition, Hybrid model, LSTM, ARIMA, XGBoost, Intelligent transportation systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23668v1)** | 2025-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate traffic flow forecasting is essential for intelligent transportation systems and urban traffic management. However, single model approaches often fail to capture the complex, nonlinear, and multi scale temporal patterns in traffic flow data. This study proposes a decomposition driven hybrid framework that integrates Seasonal Trend decomposition using Loess (STL) with three complementary predictive models. STL first decomposes the original time series into trend, seasonal, and residual components. Then, a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) network models long term trends, an Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model captures seasonal periodicity, and an Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm predicts nonlinear residual fluctuations. The final forecast is obtained through multiplicative integration of the sub model predictions. Using 998 traffic flow records from a New York City intersection between November and December 2015, results show that the LSTM ARIMA XGBoost hybrid model significantly outperforms standalone models including LSTM, ARIMA, and XGBoost across MAE, RMSE, and R squared metrics. The decomposition strategy effectively isolates temporal characteristics, allowing each model to specialize, thereby improving prediction accuracy, interpretability, and robustness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Error Adjustment Based on Spatiotemporal Correlation Fusion for Traffic Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23656v1)** | 2025-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep neural networks (DNNs) play a significant role in an increasing body of research on traffic forecasting due to their effectively capturing spatiotemporal patterns embedded in traffic data. A general assumption of training the said forecasting models via mean squared error estimation is that the errors across time steps and spatial positions are uncorrelated. However, this assumption does not really hold because of the autocorrelation caused by both the temporality and spatiality of traffic data. This gap limits the performance of DNN-based forecasting models and is overlooked by current studies. To fill up this gap, this paper proposes Spatiotemporally Autocorrelated Error Adjustment (SAEA), a novel and general framework designed to systematically adjust autocorrelated prediction errors in traffic forecasting. Unlike existing approaches that assume prediction errors follow a random Gaussian noise distribution, SAEA models these errors as a spatiotemporal vector autoregressive (VAR) process to capture their intrinsic dependencies. First, it explicitly captures both spatial and temporal error correlations by a coefficient matrix, which is then embedded into a newly formulated cost function. Second, a structurally sparse regularization is introduced to incorporate prior spatial information, ensuring that the learned coefficient matrix aligns with the inherent road network structure. Finally, an inference process with test-time error adjustment is designed to dynamically refine predictions, mitigating the impact of autocorrelated errors in real-time forecasting. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is verified on different traffic datasets. Results across a wide range of traffic forecasting models show that our method enhances performance in almost all cases.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 7 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

With the aim of overcoming such limitations, network operators are foreseeing Digital Twins (DTs) as key enablers, which are designed as dynamic and virtual replicas of network infrastructure, allowing operators to model, analyze, and optimize various operations without any risk of affecting the live network. However, for Digital Twin Networks (DTNs) to meet the challenges faced by operators especially in line with resource management, a driving engine is needed. In this paper, an AI (Artificial Intelligence)-driven approach is presented by integrating a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network into the DT framework, aimed at forecasting network traffic patterns and proactively managing resource allocation. Through analytical experiments, the AI-Enabled DT framework demonstrates superior performance benchmarked against baseline methods. Our study concludes that embedding AI capabilities within DTs paves the way for fully autonomous, adaptive, and high-performance network management in future mobile networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 fig...</summary><p>6 figures, 2 Tables, Accepted at IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM) 2025</p></details> |

This approach typically uses a computing cluster managed by a container orchestration platform to deploy microservices. However, this shift introduces significant challenges, particularly in the efficient scheduling of containerized services. These challenges are compounded by unpredictable scenarios such as dynamic incoming workloads with various execution traffic and variable communication delays among cluster nodes. Existing works often overlook the real-time traffic impacts of dynamic requests on running microservices, as well as the varied communication delays across cluster nodes. Consequently, even optimally deployed microservices could suffer from significant performance degradation over time. To address these issues, we propose a network and traffic-aware adaptive scheduling framework, TraDE, which can adaptively redeploy microservice instances to maintain desired performance amid changing traffic and network conditions within the hosting cluster. We have implemented TraDE as an extension to the Kubernetes platform. Additionally, we deployed realistic microservice applications in a real compute cluster and conducted extensive experiments to assess our framework's performance in various scenarios. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of TraDE in rescheduling running microservices to enhance end-to-end performance while maintaining a high goodput ratio. Compared with the existing method NetMARKS, TraDE outperforms it by reducing the average response time of the application by up to 48.3%, and improving the throughput by up to 1.2-1.5x across workloads while maintaining a goodput ratio of 95.36%, and showing robust adaptive capability to meet QoS targets under sustained workloads and dynamic networking conditions.</p></details> | 13 pages |

In this work, we present a detection framework designed to operate robustly under these conditions.

These methods become computationally prohibitive for large-scale networks due to non-linear growth in complexity with the number of OD pairs. This study introduces a novel data-driven approach using deep neural networks, specifically leveraging the Transformer architecture, to predict equilibrium path flows directly. By focusing on path-level traffic distribution, the proposed model captures intricate correlations between OD pairs, offering a more detailed and flexible analysis compared to traditional link-level approaches. The Transformer-based model drastically reduces computation time, while adapting to changes in demand and network structure without the need for recalculation. Numerical experiments are conducted on the Manhattan-like synthetic network, the Sioux Falls network, and the Eastern-Massachusetts network. The results demonstrate that the proposed model is orders of magnitude faster than conventional optimization. It efficiently estimates path-level traffic flows in multi-class networks, reducing computational costs and improving prediction accuracy by capturing detailed trip and flow information. The model also adapts flexibly to varying demand and network conditions, supporting traffic management and enabling rapid `what-if' analyses for enhanced transportation planning and policy-making.</p></details> |  |

Compared with traditional reinforcement learning and recent LLM-based methods, Traffic-R1 offers three main advantages: zero-shot generalization, transferring unchanged to new road networks and out-of-distribution incidents by leveraging internal traffic-control policies and reasoning; a compact 3B-parameter design that supports real-time inference on mobile-class chips for edge deployment; and an explainable TSC process that enables multi-intersection coordination through communication and an asynchronous communication network. Extensive benchmarks show Traffic-R1 outperforms strong baselines and training-intensive RL controllers. In production, the model now manages signals affecting over 55,000 drivers daily, reduces average queue lengths by more than 5%, and halves operator workload.

However, IoT networks remain vulnerable to security threats such as denial of service (DoS) attacks, anomalous traffic, and data manipulation due to decentralized architectures and limited resources. To address these issues, this paper proposes an advanced anomaly detection framework with three main phases. First, data preprocessing is performed using the Median KS Test to remove noise, handle missing values, and balance datasets for cleaner input. Second, a feature selection phase employs a Genetic Algorithm combined with eagle inspired search strategies to identify the most relevant features, reduce dimensionality, and improve efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. Finally, an ensemble classifier integrates Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost algorithms to achieve accurate and reliable anomaly detection. The proposed model demonstrates high adaptability and scalability across diverse IoT environments. Experimental results show that it outperforms existing methods by achieving 98 percent accuracy, 95 percent detection rate, and reductions in false positive (10 percent) and false negative (5 percent) rates. These results confirm the framework effectiveness and robustness in improving IoT network security against evolving cyber threats.</p></details> | 24 pages |

However, automatic traffic detectors across national road networks often provide incomplete coverage, leading to underrepresentation of minor roads. While recent machine learning advances have improved AADT estimation at unmeasured locations, most models produce only point predictions and overlook estimation uncertainty. This study addresses that gap by introducing an interval prediction approach that explicitly quantifies predictive uncertainty. We integrate a Quantile Random Forest model with Principal Component Analysis to generate AADT prediction intervals, providing plausible traffic ranges bounded by estimated minima and maxima. Using data from over 2,000 minor roads in England and Wales, and evaluated with specialized interval metrics, the proposed method achieves an interval coverage probability of 88.22%, a normalized average width of 0.23, and a Winkler Score of 7,468.47. By combining machine learning with spatial and high-dimensional analysis, this framework enhances both the accuracy and interpretability of AADT estimation, supporting more robust and informed transport planning.</p></details> |  |

To satisfy this demand, 3GPP develops a 5G Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) technology. Depending on the served traffic type, 5G V2X specifications propose two channel access methods: (i) Mode 1, according to which a base station allocates resources to users, and (ii) Mode 2, according to which users autonomously select resources for their transmissions. In the paper, we consider a scenario with sporadic traffic, e.g., a vehicle generates a packet at a random time moment when it detects a dangerous situation, which imposes strict requirements on delay and reliability. To satisfy strict delay requirements, vehicles use Mode 2. We analyze the performance of Mode 2 for sporadic traffic and propose several approaches to improve it. Simulation results show that the proposed approaches can increase the system capacity by up to 40% with a low impact on complexity.</p></details> |  |

To address this challenge, we propose FlowDet, a high-speed detector featuring a decoupled encoder optimization strategy applied to the DETR architecture. Specifically, FlowDet employs a novel Geometric Deformable Unit (GDU) for traffic-aware geometric modeling and a Scale-Aware Attention (SAA) module to maintain high representational power across extreme scale variations. To rigorously evaluate the model's performance in environments with severe occlusion and high object density, we collected the Intersection-Flow-5k dataset, a new challenging scene for this task. Evaluated on Intersection-Flow-5k, FlowDet establishes a new state-of-the-art. Compared to the strong RT-DETR baseline, it improves AP(test) by 1.5% and AP50(test) by 1.6%, while simultaneously reducing GFLOPs by 63.2% and increasing inference speed by 16.2%.

Since each node in such environments generates various types of data with diverse service requirements, MAC protocol holds crucial importance to ensure efficient delivery. In this context, simple to complex MAC schemes are found in literature. This paper focuses on evaluating the performance of two major techniques "slot stealing" and "packet fragmentation" for the IIoT; representative protocols SS-MAC and FROG-MAC have been chosen from each category respectively. We conducted realistic simulations for the two protocols using Contiki. Delay and packet loss comparison for SS-MAC and FROG-MAC indicates the superiority of FROG-MAC due to reduction in the waiting time for urgent traffic. Thus, a simple fragmentation scheme could be deployed for efficient scheduling of heterogenous traffic in the industrial environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Smart Traffic Signals: Comparing MARL and Fixed-Time Strategies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14544v3)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Urban traffic congestion, particularly at intersections, significantly impacts travel time, fuel consumption, and emissions. Traditional fixed-time signal control systems often lack the adaptability to manage dynamic traffic patterns effectively. This study explores the application of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to optimize traffic signal coordination across multiple intersections within a simulated environment. Utilizing Pygame, a simulation was developed to model a network of interconnected intersections with randomly generated vehicle flows to reflect realistic traffic variability. A decentralized MARL controller was implemented, in which each traffic signal operates as an autonomous agent, making decisions based on local observations and information from neighboring agents. Performance was evaluated against a baseline fixed-time controller using metrics such as average vehicle wait time and overall throughput. The MARL approach demonstrated statistically significant improvements, including reduced average waiting times and improved throughput. These findings suggest that MARL-based dynamic control strategies hold substantial promise for improving urban traffic management efficiency. More research is recommended to address scalability and real-world implementation challenges.</p></details> |  |

Traffic signaling is a key component in effective traffic management for such situations, but the advancements in intelligent traffic signaling have been exclusive to developed countries with structured traffic. The non-lane-based, heterogeneous traffic of Dhaka City requires a contextual approach. This study focuses on the development of an intelligent traffic signaling system feasible in the context of developing countries such as Bangladesh. We propose a pipeline leveraging Real Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP) feeds, a low resources system Raspberry Pi 4B processing, and a state of the art YOLO-based object detection model trained on the Non-lane-based and Heterogeneous Traffic (NHT-1071) dataset to detect and classify heterogeneous traffic. A multi-objective optimization algorithm, NSGA-II, then generates optimized signal timings, minimizing waiting time while maximizing vehicle throughput. We test our implementation in a five-road intersection at Palashi, Dhaka, demonstrating the potential to significantly improve traffic management in similar situations. The developed testbed paves the way for more contextual and effective Intelligent Traffic Signaling (ITS) solutions for developing areas with complicated traffic dynamics such as Dhaka City.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems (T-ITS)</p></details> |

The key to building a logically centralized but physically distributed control-plane is running diverse cluster management protocols to achieve consistency through an exchange of control traffic. Meanwhile, we observe that the control traffic exposes unique time-series patterns and directional relationships due to the operational structure even though the traffic is encrypted, and this pattern can disclose confidential information such as control-plane topology and protocol dependencies, which can be exploited for severe attacks. With this insight, we propose a new SD-WAN fingerprinting system, called Heimdallr. It analyzes periodical and operational patterns of SD-WAN cluster management protocols and the context of flow directions from the collected control traffic utilizing a deep learning-based approach, so that it can classify the cluster management protocols automatically from miscellaneous control traffic datasets. Our evaluation, which is performed in a realistic SD-WAN environment consisting of geographically distant three campus networks and one enterprise network shows that Heimdallr can classify SD-WAN control traffic with $\geq$ 93%, identify individual protocols with $\geq$ 80% macro F-1 scores, and finally can infer control-plane topology with $\geq$ 70% similarity.</p></details> | 14 pages, 14 figures |
| **[Hypergame-based Cognition Modeling and Intention Interpretation for Human-Driven Vehicles in Connected Mixed Traffic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15573v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the practical implementation of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs), the traffic system is expected to remain a mix of CAVs and human-driven vehicles (HVs) for the foreseeable future. To enhance safety and traffic efficiency, the trajectory planning strategies of CAVs must account for the influence of HVs, necessitating accurate HV trajectory prediction. Current research often assumes that human drivers have perfect knowledge of all vehicles' objectives, an unrealistic premise. This paper bridges the gap by leveraging hypergame theory to account for cognitive and perception limitations in HVs. We model human bounded rationality without assuming them to be merely passive followers and propose a hierarchical cognition modeling framework that captures cognitive relationships among vehicles. We further analyze the cognitive stability of the system, proving that the strategy profile where all vehicles adopt cognitively equilibrium strategies constitutes a hyper Nash equilibrium when CAVs accurately learn HV parameters. To achieve this, we develop an inverse learning algorithm for distributed intention interpretation via vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication, which extends the framework to both offline and online scenarios. Additionally, we introduce a distributed trajectory prediction and planning approach for CAVs, leveraging the learned parameters in real time. Simulations in highway lane-changing scenarios demonstrate the proposed method's accuracy in parameter learning, robustness to noisy trajectory observations, and safety in HV trajectory prediction. The results validate the effectiveness of our method in both offline and online implementations.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods - ranging from rule-based heuristics to reinforcement learning (RL) - often struggle to generalize to complex, dynamic, and safety-critical scenarios. We introduce VLMLight, a novel TSC framework that integrates vision-language meta-control with dual-branch reasoning. At the core of VLMLight is the first image-based traffic simulator that enables multi-view visual perception at intersections, allowing policies to reason over rich cues such as vehicle type, motion, and spatial density. A large language model (LLM) serves as a safety-prioritized meta-controller, selecting between a fast RL policy for routine traffic and a structured reasoning branch for critical cases. In the latter, multiple LLM agents collaborate to assess traffic phases, prioritize emergency vehicles, and verify rule compliance. Experiments show that VLMLight reduces waiting times for emergency vehicles by up to 65% over RL-only systems, while preserving real-time performance in standard conditions with less than 1% degradation. VLMLight offers a scalable, interpretable, and safety-aware solution for next-generation traffic signal control.</p></details> | 25 pages, 15 figures |
| **[A Survey and Benchmarking of Spatial-Temporal Traffic Data Imputation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04733v2)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic data imputation is a critical preprocessing step in intelligent transportation systems, underpinning the reliability of downstream transportation services. Despite substantial progress in imputation models, model selection and development for practical applications remains challenging due to three key gaps: 1) the absence of a model taxonomy for traffic data imputation to trace the technological development and highlight their distinct features. 2) the lack of unified benchmarking pipeline for fair and reproducible model evaluation across standardized traffic datasets. 3) insufficient in-depth analysis that jointly compare models across multiple dimensions, including effectiveness, computational efficiency and robustness. To this end, this paper proposes practice-oriented taxonomies for traffic data missing patterns and imputation models, systematically cataloging real-world traffic data loss scenarios and analyzing the characteristics of existing models. We further introduce a unified benchmarking pipeline to comprehensively evaluate 11 representative models across various missing patterns and rates, assessing overall performance, performance under challenging scenarios, computational efficiency, and providing visualizations. This work aims to provide a holistic perspective on traffic data imputation and to serve as a practical guideline for model selection and application in intelligent transportation systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Intention-driven Lane Change Framework Considering Heterogeneous Dynamic Cooperation in Mixed-traffic Environment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22550v3)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In mixed-traffic environments, where autonomous vehicles (AVs) interact with diverse human-driven vehicles (HVs), unpredictable intentions and heterogeneous behaviors make safe and efficient lane change maneuvers highly challenging. Existing methods often oversimplify these interactions by assuming uniform patterns. We propose an intention-driven lane change framework that integrates driving-style recognition, cooperation-aware decision-making, and coordinated motion planning. A deep learning classifier trained on the NGSIM dataset identifies human driving styles in real time. A cooperation score with intrinsic and interactive components estimates surrounding drivers' intentions and quantifies their willingness to cooperate with the ego vehicle. Decision-making combines behavior cloning with inverse reinforcement learning to determine whether a lane change should be initiated. For trajectory generation, model predictive control is integrated with IRL-based intention inference to produce collision-free and socially compliant maneuvers. Experiments show that the proposed model achieves 94.2\% accuracy and 94.3\% F1-score, outperforming rule-based and learning-based baselines by 4-15\% in lane change recognition. These results highlight the benefit of modeling inter-driver heterogeneity and demonstrate the potential of the framework to advance context-aware and human-like autonomous driving in complex traffic environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[HOB: A Holistically Optimized Bidding Strategy under Heterogeneous Auction Mechanisms with Organic Traffic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15238v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The E-commerce advertising platforms typically sell commercial traffic through either second-price auction (SPA) or first-price auction (FPA). SPA was historically prevalent due to its dominant strategy incentive-compatible (DSIC) for bidders with quasi-linear utilities, especially when budgets are not a binding constraint, while FPA has gained more prominence for offering higher revenue potential to publishers and avoiding the possibility for discriminatory treatment in personalized reserve prices. Meanwhile, on the demand side, advertisers are increasingly adopting platform-wide marketing solutions akin to QuanZhanTui, shifting from spending budgets solely on commercial traffic to bidding on the entire traffic for the purpose of maximizing overall sales. For automated bidding systems, such a trend poses a critical challenge: determining optimal strategies across heterogeneous auction channels to fulfill diverse advertiser objectives, such as maximizing return (MaxReturn) or meeting target return on ad spend (TargetROAS). To overcome this challenge, this work makes two key contributions. First, we derive an efficient solution for optimal bidding under FPA channels, which takes into account the presence of organic traffic - traffic can be won for free. Second, we introduce a marginal cost alignment (MCA) strategy that provably secures bidding efficiency across heterogeneous auction mechanisms. To validate performance of our developed framework, we conduct comprehensive offline experiments on public datasets and large-scale online A/B testing, which demonstrate consistent improvements over existing methods.</p></details> |  |

The system is abstracted as a graph with nodes and edges, where node features represent traffic and resource states, and adjacency relations describe service interactions. A graph convolution mechanism enables multi order propagation and aggregation of node features, while a gated recurrent structure models historical sequences dynamically, thus integrating spatial structures with temporal evolution. A spatiotemporal joint modeling module further fuses graph representation with temporal dependency, and a decoder generates future traffic predictions. The model is trained with mean squared error to minimize deviations from actual values. Experiments based on public distributed system logs construct combined inputs of node features, topology, and sequences, and compare the proposed method with mainstream baselines using MSE, RMSE, MAE, and MAPE. Results show that the proposed method achieves stable performance and low error across different prediction horizons and model depths, significantly improving the accuracy and robustness of traffic forecasting in distributed backend systems and verifying the potential of graph neural networks in complex system modeling.</p></details> |  |

However, despite recent breakthroughs such as Veo 3's chain-of-frames reasoning, it remains unclear whether these models can exhibit reasoning capabilities similar to large language models (LLMs). Existing benchmarks predominantly evaluate visual fidelity and temporal coherence, failing to capture higher-order reasoning abilities. To bridge this gap, we propose TiViBench, a hierarchical benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the reasoning capabilities of image-to-video (I2V) generation models. TiViBench systematically assesses reasoning across four dimensions: i) Structural Reasoning & Search, ii) Spatial & Visual Pattern Reasoning, iii) Symbolic & Logical Reasoning, and iv) Action Planning & Task Execution, spanning 24 diverse task scenarios across 3 difficulty levels. Through extensive evaluations, we show that commercial models (e.g., Sora 2, Veo 3.1) demonstrate stronger reasoning potential, while open-source models reveal untapped potential that remains hindered by limited training scale and data diversity. To further unlock this potential, we introduce VideoTPO, a simple yet effective test-time strategy inspired by preference optimization. By performing LLM self-analysis on generated candidates to identify strengths and weaknesses, VideoTPO significantly enhances reasoning performance without requiring additional training, data, or reward models. Together, TiViBench and VideoTPO pave the way for evaluating and advancing reasoning in video generation models, setting a foundation for future research in this emerging field.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project: https://haroldchen19.github.io/TiViBench-Page/</p></details> |

We present OlmoEarth: a multimodal, spatio-temporal foundation model that employs a novel self-supervised learning formulation, masking strategy, and loss all designed for the Earth observation domain. OlmoEarth achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to 12 other foundation models across a variety of research benchmarks and real-world tasks from external partners.

| **[Mapping the Vanishing and Transformation of Urban Villages in China](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13507v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Urban villages (UVs), informal settlements embedded within China's urban fabric, have undergone widespread demolition and redevelopment in recent decades. However, there remains a lack of systematic evaluation of whether the demolished land has been effectively reused, raising concerns about the efficacy and sustainability of current redevelopment practices. To address the gap, this study proposes a deep learning-based framework to monitor the spatiotemporal changes of UVs in China. Specifically, semantic segmentation of multi-temporal remote sensing imagery is first used to map evolving UV boundaries, and then post-demolition land use is classified into six categories based on the "remained-demolished-redeveloped" phase: incomplete demolition, vacant land, construction sites, buildings, green spaces, and others. Four representative cities from China's four economic regions were selected as the study areas, i.e., Guangzhou (East), Zhengzhou (Central), Xi'an (West), and Harbin (Northeast). The results indicate: 1) UV redevelopment processes were frequently prolonged; 2) redevelopment transitions primarily occurred in peripheral areas, whereas urban cores remained relatively stable; and 3) three spatiotemporal transformation pathways, i.e., synchronized redevelopment, delayed redevelopment, and gradual optimization, were revealed. This study highlights the fragmented, complex and nonlinear nature of UV redevelopment, underscoring the need for tiered and context-sensitive planning strategies. By linking spatial dynamics with the context of redevelopment policies, the findings offer valuable empirical insights that support more inclusive, efficient, and sustainable urban renewal, while also contributing to a broader global understanding of informal settlement transformations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Appen...</summary><p>Appendix A.

| **[GREAT: Generalizable Representation Enhancement via Auxiliary Transformations for Zero-Shot Environmental Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13469v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Environmental modeling faces critical challenges in predicting ecosystem dynamics across unmonitored regions due to limited and geographically imbalanced observation data. This challenge is compounded by spatial heterogeneity, causing models to learn spurious patterns that fit only local data. Unlike conventional domain generalization, environmental modeling must preserve invariant physical relationships and temporal coherence during augmentation. In this paper, we introduce Generalizable Representation Enhancement via Auxiliary Transformations (GREAT), a framework that effectively augments available datasets to improve predictions in completely unseen regions. GREAT guides the augmentation process to ensure that the original governing processes can be recovered from the augmented data, and the inclusion of the augmented data leads to improved model generalization. Specifically, GREAT learns transformation functions at multiple layers of neural networks to augment both raw environmental features and temporal influence. They are refined through a novel bi-level training process that constrains augmented data to preserve key patterns of the original source data. We demonstrate GREAT's effectiveness on stream temperature prediction across six ecologically diverse watersheds in the eastern U.S., each containing multiple stream segments. Experimental results show that GREAT significantly outperforms existing methods in zero-shot scenarios. This work provides a practical solution for environmental applications where comprehensive monitoring is infeasible.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatial disaggregation of time series](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04065v2)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatiotemporal modeling of economic aggregates is increasingly relevant in regional science due to the presence of both spatial spillovers and temporal dynamics. Traditional temporal disaggregation methods, such as Chow-Lin, often ignore spatial dependence, potentially losing important regional information. We propose a novel methodology for spatiotemporal disaggregation, integrating spatial autoregressive models, benchmarking restrictions, and auxiliary covariates. The approach accommodates partially observed regional data through an anchoring mechanism, ensuring consistency with known aggregates while reducing prediction variance. We establish identifiability and asymptotic normality of the estimator under general conditions, including non-Gaussian and heteroskedastic residuals. Extensive simulations confirm the method's robustness across a wide range of spatial autocorrelations and covariate informativeness. The methodology is illustrated by disaggregating Spanish GDP into 17 autonomous communities from 2002 to 2023, using auxiliary indicators and principal component analysis for dimensionality reduction. This framework extends classical temporal disaggregation to the spatial domain, providing accurate regional estimates while accounting for spatial spillovers and irregular data availability.</p></details> |  |
| **[PAST: A Primary-Auxiliary Spatio-Temporal Network for Traffic Time Series Imputation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13414v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic time series imputation is crucial for the safety and reliability of intelligent transportation systems, while diverse types of missing data, including random, fiber, and block missing make the imputation task challenging. Existing models often focus on disentangling and separately modeling spatial and temporal patterns based on relationships between data points. However, these approaches struggle to adapt to the random missing positions, and fail to learn long-term and large-scale dependencies, which are essential in extensive missing conditions. In this paper, patterns are categorized into two types to handle various missing data conditions: primary patterns, which originate from internal relationships between data points, and auxiliary patterns, influenced by external factors like timestamps and node attributes. Accordingly, we propose the Primary-Auxiliary Spatio-Temporal network (PAST). It comprises a graph-integrated module (GIM) and a cross-gated module (CGM). GIM captures primary patterns via dynamic graphs with interval-aware dropout and multi-order convolutions, and CGM extracts auxiliary patterns through bidirectional gating on embedded external features. The two modules interact via shared hidden vectors and are trained under an ensemble self-supervised framework. Experiments on three datasets under 27 missing data conditions demonstrate that the imputation accuracy of PAST outperforms seven state-of-the-art baselines by up to 26.2% in RMSE and 31.6% in MAE.</p></details> |  |

To address these issues, recent works have proposed training-free compression methods. However, existing efforts often suffer from three major limitations: (1) Current approaches do not decompose techniques into comparable modules, hindering fair evaluation across spatial and temporal redundancy. (2) Evaluation confined to simple single-turn tasks, failing to reflect performance in realistic scenarios. (3) Isolated use of individual compression techniques, without exploring their joint potential. To overcome these gaps, we introduce LLMC+, a comprehensive VLM compression benchmark with a versatile, plug-and-play toolkit. LLMC+ supports over 20 algorithms across five representative VLM families and enables systematic study of token-level and model-level compression. Our benchmark reveals that: (1) Spatial and temporal redundancies demand distinct technical strategies. (2) Token reduction methods degrade significantly in multi-turn dialogue and detail-sensitive tasks. (3) Combining token and model compression achieves extreme compression with minimal performance loss. We believe LLMC+ will facilitate fair evaluation and inspire future research in efficient VLM.

This design relies on heuristic operations such as detection, RoI cropping, and non-maximum suppression (NMS), limiting both accuracy and efficiency. In this paper, we present a fully end-to-end framework for multi-person 2D pose estimation in videos, effectively eliminating heuristic operations. A key challenge is to associate individuals across frames under complex and overlapping temporal trajectories. To address this, we introduce a novel Pose-Aware Video transformEr Network (PAVE-Net), which features a spatial encoder to model intra-frame relations and a spatiotemporal pose decoder to capture global dependencies across frames. To achieve accurate temporal association, we propose a pose-aware attention mechanism that enables each pose query to selectively aggregate features corresponding to the same individual across consecutive frames.Additionally, we explicitly model spatiotemporal dependencies among pose keypoints to improve accuracy. Notably, our approach is the first end-to-end method for multi-frame 2D human pose estimation.Extensive experiments show that PAVE-Net substantially outperforms prior image-based end-to-end methods, achieving a \textbf{6.0} mAP improvement on PoseTrack2017, and delivers accuracy competitive with state-of-the-art two-stage video-based approaches, while offering significant gains in efficiency.Project page: https://github.com/zgspose/PAVENet</p></details> |  |

However, most existing occupancy world models rely on static and fixed embeddings or grids, which inherently limit the flexibility of perception. Moreover, their ``in-place classification" over grids exhibits a potential misalignment with the dynamic and continuous nature of real scenarios. In this paper, we propose SparseWorld, a novel 4D occupancy world model that is flexible, adaptive, and efficient, powered by sparse and dynamic queries. We propose a Range-Adaptive Perception module, in which learnable queries are modulated by the ego vehicle states and enriched with temporal-spatial associations to enable extended-range perception. To effectively capture the dynamics of the scene, we design a State-Conditioned Forecasting module, which replaces classification-based forecasting with regression-guided formulation, precisely aligning the dynamic queries with the continuity of the 4D environment. In addition, We specifically devise a Temporal-Aware Self-Scheduling training strategy to enable smooth and efficient training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SparseWorld achieves state-of-the-art performance across perception, forecasting, and planning tasks. Comprehensive visualizations and ablation studies further validate the advantages of SparseWorld in terms of flexibility, adaptability, and efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI2026 Code: https://github.com/MSunDYY/SparseWorld</p></details> |

This paper presents a dynamic recurrent adjacency memory network (DRAMN) that combines physics-informed analysis with deep learning for real-time power system stability forecasting. The framework employs sliding-window dynamic mode decomposition to construct time-varying, multi-layer adjacency matrices from phasor measurement unit and sensor data to capture system dynamics such as modal participation factors, coupling strengths, phase relationships, and spectral energy distributions. As opposed to processing spatial and temporal dependencies separately, DRAMN integrates graph convolution operations directly within recurrent gating mechanisms, enabling simultaneous modeling of evolving dynamics and temporal dependencies. Extensive validations on modified IEEE 9-bus, 39-bus, and a multi-terminal HVDC network demonstrate high performance, achieving 99.85%, 99.90%, and 99.69% average accuracies, respectively, surpassing all tested benchmarks, including classical machine learning algorithms and recent graph-based models. The framework identifies optimal combinations of measurements that reduce feature dimensionality by 82% without performance degradation. Correlation analysis between dominant measurements for small-signal and transient stability events validates generalizability across different stability phenomena. DRAMN achieves state-of-the-art accuracy while providing enhanced interpretability for power system operators, making it suitable for real-time deployment in modern control centers.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Power Systems</p></details> |

A key component in scaling these models is population-level representation learning, which leverages information across channels to capture spatial as well as temporal structure. Population-level approaches have recently shown that such representations can be both efficient to learn on top of pretrained temporal encoders and produce useful representations for decoding a variety of downstream tasks. However, these models remain sensitive to mismatches in preprocessing, particularly on time-scales, between pretraining and downstream settings. We systematically examine how time-scale mismatches affects generalization and find that existing representations lack invariance. To address this, we introduce Time-scale Augmented Pretraining (TSAP), which consistently improves robustness to different time-scales across decoding tasks and builds invariance in the representation space. These results highlight handling preprocessing diversity as a key step toward building generalizable neural foundation models.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures, NeurIPS 2025 Foundation Models for the Brain and Body</p></details> |

Many learning-based and model-based methods exist that estimate event-based optical flow, however the temporally dense yet spatially sparse nature of events poses significant challenges. To address these issues, contrast maximization (CM) is a prominent model-based optimization methodology that estimates the motion trajectories of events within an event volume by optimally warping them. Since its introduction, the CM framework has undergone a series of refinements by the computer vision community. Nonetheless, it remains a highly non-convex optimization problem. In this paper, we introduce a novel biologically-inspired hybrid CM method for event-based optical flow estimation that couples visual and inertial motion cues. Concretely, we propose the use of orientation maps, derived from camera 3D velocities, as priors to guide the CM process. The orientation maps provide directional guidance and constrain the space of estimated motion trajectories. We show that this orientation-guided formulation leads to improved robustness and convergence in event-based optical flow estimation. The evaluation of our approach on the MVSEC, DSEC, and ECD datasets yields superior accuracy scores over the state of the art.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 9 figures, and 3 tables</p></details> |

However, its sparse point clouds pose significant challenges for semantic understanding. We present RadarLLM, the first framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) for human motion understanding from radar signals. RadarLLM introduces two key innovations: (1) a motion-guided radar tokenizer based on our Aggregate VQ-VAE architecture, integrating deformable body templates and masked trajectory modeling to convert spatial-temporal radar sequences into compact semantic tokens; and (2) a radar-aware language model that establishes cross-modal alignment between radar and text in a shared embedding space. To overcome the scarcity of paired radar-text data, we generate a realistic radar-text dataset from motion-text datasets with a physics-aware synthesis pipeline. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks show that RadarLLM achieves state-of-the-art performance, enabling robust and interpretable motion understanding under privacy and visibility constraints, even in adverse environments.

While ARC has inspired extensive research on abstract reasoning, most existing approaches rely on static input--output supervision, which limits insight into how reasoning unfolds over time. ARCTraj addresses this gap by recording temporally ordered, object-level actions that capture how humans iteratively transform inputs into outputs, revealing intermediate reasoning steps that conventional datasets overlook. Collected via the O2ARC web interface, it contains around 10,000 trajectories annotated with task identifiers, timestamps, and success labels across 400 training tasks from the ARC-AGI-1 benchmark. It further defines a unified reasoning pipeline encompassing data collection, action abstraction, Markov decision process (MDP) formulation, and downstream learning, enabling integration with reinforcement learning, generative modeling, and sequence modeling methods such as PPO, World Models, GFlowNets, Diffusion agents, and Decision Transformers. Analyses of spatial selection, color attribution, and strategic convergence highlight the structure and diversity of human reasoning. Together, these contributions position ARCTraj as a structured and interpretable foundation for studying human-like reasoning, advancing explainability, alignment, and generalizable intelligence.</p></details> |  |
| **[Understanding Dynamic Scenes in Ego Centric 4D Point Clouds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07251v3)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding dynamic 4D scenes from an egocentric perspective-modeling changes in 3D spatial structure over time-is crucial for human-machine interaction, autonomous navigation, and embodied intelligence. While existing egocentric datasets contain dynamic scenes, they lack unified 4D annotations and task-driven evaluation protocols for fine-grained spatio-temporal reasoning, especially on motion of objects and human, together with their interactions. To address this gap, we introduce EgoDynamic4D, a novel QA benchmark on highly dynamic scenes, comprising RGB-D video, camera poses, globally unique instance masks, and 4D bounding boxes. We construct 927K QA pairs accompanied by explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT), enabling verifiable, step-by-step spatio-temporal reasoning. We design 12 dynamic QA tasks covering agent motion, human-object interaction, trajectory prediction, relation understanding, and temporal-causal reasoning, with fine-grained, multidimensional metrics. To tackle these tasks, we propose an end-to-end spatio-temporal reasoning framework that unifies dynamic and static scene information, using instance-aware feature encoding, time and camera encoding, and spatially adaptive down-sampling to compress large 4D scenes into token sequences manageable by LLMs. Experiments on EgoDynamic4D show that our method consistently outperforms baselines, validating the effectiveness of multimodal temporal modeling for egocentric dynamic scene understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a poster to AAAI 2026; will be published in the proceedings</p></details> |
| **[Task-Driven Implicit Representations for Automated Design of LiDAR Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22344v2)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Imaging system design is a complex, time-consuming, and largely manual process; LiDAR design, ubiquitous in mobile devices, autonomous vehicles, and aerial imaging platforms, adds further complexity through unique spatial and temporal sampling requirements. In this work, we propose a framework for automated, task-driven LiDAR system design under arbitrary constraints. To achieve this, we represent LiDAR configurations in a continuous six-dimensional design space and learn task-specific implicit densities in this space via flow-based generative modeling. We then synthesize new LiDAR systems by modeling sensors as parametric distributions in 6D space and fitting these distributions to our learned implicit density using expectation-maximization, enabling efficient, constraint-aware LiDAR system design. We validate our method on diverse tasks in 3D vision, enabling automated LiDAR system design across real-world-inspired applications in face scanning, robotic tracking, and object detection.</p></details> |  |
| **[Predicting upcoming visual features during eye movements yields scene representations aligned with human visual cortex](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12715v1)** | 2025-11-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scenes are complex, yet structured collections of parts, including objects and surfaces, that exhibit spatial and semantic relations to one another. An effective visual system therefore needs unified scene representations that relate scene parts to their location and their co-occurrence. We hypothesize that this structure can be learned self-supervised from natural experience by exploiting the temporal regularities of active vision: each fixation reveals a locally-detailed glimpse that is statistically related to the previous one via co-occurrence and saccade-conditioned spatial regularities. We instantiate this idea with Glimpse Prediction Networks (GPNs) -- recurrent models trained to predict the feature embedding of the next glimpse along human-like scanpaths over natural scenes. GPNs successfully learn co-occurrence structure and, when given relative saccade location vectors, show sensitivity to spatial arrangement. Furthermore, recurrent variants of GPNs were able to integrate information across glimpses into a unified scene representation. Notably, these scene representations align strongly with human fMRI responses during natural-scene viewing across mid/high-level visual cortex. Critically, GPNs outperform architecture- and dataset-matched controls trained with explicit semantic objectives, and match or exceed strong modern vision baselines, leaving little unique variance for those alternatives. These results establish next-glimpse prediction during active vision as a biologically plausible, self-supervised route to brain-aligned scene representations learned from natural visual experience.</p></details> | 28 pages, 12 figures |

However, existing Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) methods for humanoid robots neglect morphological symmetry of the robot, leading to uncoordinated and suboptimal behaviors. Inspired by human motor control, we propose Symmetry Equivariant Policy (SE-Policy), a new DRL framework that embeds strict symmetry equivariance in the actor and symmetry invariance in the critic without additional hyperparameters. SE-Policy enforces consistent behaviors across symmetric observations, producing temporally and spatially coordinated motions with higher task performance. Extensive experiments on velocity tracking tasks, conducted in both simulation and real-world deployment with the Unitree G1 humanoid robot, demonstrate that SE-Policy improves tracking accuracy by up to 40% compared to state-of-the-art baselines, while achieving superior spatial-temporal coordination. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of SE-Policy and its broad applicability to humanoid robots.</p></details> | AAAI 2026 accepted |

Current advanced optical flow methods for event cameras largely adopt established image-based frameworks. However, the spatial sparsity of event data limits their performance. In this paper, we present BAT, an innovative framework that estimates event-based optical flow using bidirectional adaptive temporal correlation. BAT includes three novel designs: 1) a bidirectional temporal correlation that transforms bidirectional temporally dense motion cues into spatially dense ones, enabling accurate and spatially dense optical flow estimation; 2) an adaptive temporal sampling strategy for maintaining temporal consistency in correlation; 3) spatially adaptive temporal motion aggregation to efficiently and adaptively aggregate consistent target motion features into adjacent motion features while suppressing inconsistent ones. Our results rank $1^{st}$ on the DSEC-Flow benchmark, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods by a large margin while also exhibiting sharp edges and high-quality details. Notably, our BAT can accurately predict future optical flow using only past events, significantly outperforming E-RAFT's warm-start approach.

| **[A spatio-temporal statistical model for property valuation at country-scale with adjustments for regional submarkets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12625v1)** | 2025-11-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Valuing residential property is inherently complex, requiring consideration of numerous environmental, economic, and property-specific factors. These complexities present significant challenges for automated valuation models (AVMs), which are increasingly used to provide objective assessments for property taxation and mortgage financing. The challenge of obtaining accurate and objective valuations for properties at a country level, and not just within major cities, is further compounded by the presence of multiple localised submarkets-spanning urban, suburban, and rural contexts-where property features contribute differently to value. Existing AVMs often struggle in such settings: traditional hedonic regression models lack the flexibility to capture spatial variation, while advanced machine learning approaches demand extensive datasets that are rarely available. In this article, we address these limitations by developing a robust statistical framework for property valuation in the Irish housing market. We segment the country into six submarkets encompassing cities, large towns, and rural areas, and employ a generalized additive model that captures non-linear effects of property characteristics while allowing feature contributions to vary across submarkets. Our approach outperforms both machine learning-based and traditional hedonic regression models, particularly in data-sparse regions. In out-of-sample validation, our model achieves R-squared values of 0.70, 0.84, and 0.83 for rural areas, towns, and Dublin, respectively, compared to 0.52, 0.71, and 0.82 from a random forest benchmark. Furthermore, the temporal dynamics of our model align closely with reported inflation figures for the study period, providing additional validation of its accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pixels or Positions? Benchmarking Modalities in Group Activity Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12606v1)** | 2025-11-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Group Activity Recognition (GAR) is well studied on the video modality for surveillance and indoor team sports (e.g., volleyball, basketball). Yet, other modalities such as agent positions and trajectories over time, i.e. tracking, remain comparatively under-explored despite being compact, agent-centric signals that explicitly encode spatial interactions. Understanding whether pixel (video) or position (tracking) modalities leads to better group activity recognition is therefore important to drive further research on the topic. However, no standardized benchmark currently exists that aligns broadcast video and tracking data for the same group activities, leading to a lack of apples-to-apples comparison between these modalities for GAR. In this work, we introduce SoccerNet-GAR, a multimodal dataset built from the $64$ matches of the football World Cup 2022. Specifically, the broadcast videos and player tracking modalities for $94{,}285$ group activities are synchronized and annotated with $10$ categories. Furthermore, we define a unified evaluation protocol to benchmark two strong unimodal approaches: (i) a competitive video-based classifiers and (ii) a tracking-based classifiers leveraging graph neural networks. In particular, our novel role-aware graph architecture for tracking-based GAR directly encodes tactical structure through positional edges and temporal attention. Our tracking model achieves $67.2\%$ balanced accuracy compared to $58.1\%$ for the best video baseline, while training $4.25 \times$ faster with $438 \times$ fewer parameters ($197K$ \vs $86.3M$). This study provides new insights into the relative strengths of pixels and positions for group activity recognition. Overall, it highlights the importance of modality choice and role-aware modeling for GAR.</p></details> |  |
| **[Failures to Surface Harmful Contents in Video Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10974v2)** | 2025-11-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) are increasingly deployed on numerous critical applications, where users rely on auto-generated summaries while casually skimming the video stream. We show that this interaction hides a critical safety gap: if harmful content is embedded in a video, either as full-frame inserts or as small corner patches, state-of-the-art VideoLLMs rarely mention the harmful content in the output, despite its clear visibility to human viewers. A root-cause analysis reveals three compounding design flaws: (1) insufficient temporal coverage resulting from the sparse, uniformly spaced frame sampling used by most leading VideoLLMs, (2) spatial information loss introduced by aggressive token downsampling within sampled frames, and (3) encoder-decoder disconnection, whereby visual cues are only weakly utilized during text generation. Leveraging these insights, we craft three zero-query black-box attacks, aligning with these flaws in the processing pipeline. Our large-scale evaluation across five leading VideoLLMs shows that the harmfulness omission rate exceeds 90% in most cases. Even when harmful content is clearly present in all frames, these models consistently fail to identify it. These results underscore a fundamental vulnerability in current VideoLLMs' designs and highlight the urgent need for sampling strategies, token compression, and decoding mechanisms that guarantee semantic coverage rather than speed alone.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 8 figures.

| **[Video Signature: Implicit Watermarking for Video Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00652v4)** | 2025-11-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid development of Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) has led to significant progress in video generation, but also raises serious concerns about intellectual property protection and reliable content tracing. Watermarking is a widely adopted solution to this issue, yet existing methods for video generation mainly follow a post-generation paradigm, which often fails to effectively balance the trade-off between video quality and watermark extraction. Meanwhile, current in-generation methods that embed the watermark into the initial Gaussian noise usually incur substantial additional computation. To address these issues, we propose \textbf{Video Signature} (\textsc{VidSig}), an implicit watermarking method for video diffusion models that enables imperceptible and adaptive watermark integration during video generation with almost no extra latency. Specifically, we partially fine-tune the latent decoder, where \textbf{Perturbation-Aware Suppression} (PAS) pre-identifies and freezes perceptually sensitive layers to preserve visual quality. Beyond spatial fidelity, we further enhance temporal consistency by introducing a lightweight \textbf{Temporal Alignment} module that guides the decoder to generate coherent frame sequences during fine-tuning. Experimental results show that \textsc{VidSig} achieves the best trade-off among watermark extraction accuracy, video quality, and watermark latency. It also demonstrates strong robustness against both spatial and temporal tamper, and remains stable across different video lengths and resolutions, highlighting its practicality in real-world scenarios.</p></details> | 17 pages, 13 figures |
| **[Spatio-Temporal Context Learning with Temporal Difference Convolution for Moving Infrared Small Target Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09352v2)** | 2025-11-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Moving infrared small target detection (IRSTD) plays a critical role in practical applications, such as surveillance of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and UAV-based search system. Moving IRSTD still remains highly challenging due to weak target features and complex background interference. Accurate spatio-temporal feature modeling is crucial for moving target detection, typically achieved through either temporal differences or spatio-temporal (3D) convolutions. Temporal difference can explicitly leverage motion cues but exhibits limited capability in extracting spatial features, whereas 3D convolution effectively represents spatio-temporal features yet lacks explicit awareness of motion dynamics along the temporal dimension. In this paper, we propose a novel moving IRSTD network (TDCNet), which effectively extracts and enhances spatio-temporal features for accurate target detection. Specifically, we introduce a novel temporal difference convolution (TDC) re-parameterization module that comprises three parallel TDC blocks designed to capture contextual dependencies across different temporal ranges. Each TDC block fuses temporal difference and 3D convolution into a unified spatio-temporal convolution representation. This re-parameterized module can effectively capture multi-scale motion contextual features while suppressing pseudo-motion clutter in complex backgrounds, significantly improving detection performance. Moreover, we propose a TDC-guided spatio-temporal attention mechanism that performs cross-attention between the spatio-temporal features from the TDC-based backbone and a parallel 3D backbone. This mechanism models their global semantic dependencies to refine the current frame's features. Extensive experiments on IRSTD-UAV and public infrared datasets demonstrate that our TDCNet achieves state-of-the-art detection performance in moving target detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026</p></details> |

However, traffic forecasting remains challenging due to two key factors: (1) complex spatial dependencies arising from dynamic interactions between road segments and traffic sensors across the network, and (2) the coexistence of multi-scale periodic patterns (e.g., daily and weekly periodic patterns driven by human routines) with irregular fluctuations caused by unpredictable events (e.g., accidents, weather, or construction). To tackle these challenges, we propose HyperD (Hybrid Periodic Decoupling), a novel framework that decouples traffic data into periodic and residual components. The periodic component is handled by the Hybrid Periodic Representation Module, which extracts fine-grained daily and weekly patterns using learnable periodic embeddings and spatial-temporal attention. The residual component, which captures non-periodic, high-frequency fluctuations, is modeled by the Frequency-Aware Residual Representation Module, leveraging complex-valued MLP in frequency domain. To enforce semantic separation between the two components, we further introduce a Dual-View Alignment Loss, which aligns low-frequency information with the periodic branch and high-frequency information with the residual branch. Extensive experiments on four real-world traffic datasets demonstrate that HyperD achieves state-of-the-art prediction accuracy, while offering superior robustness under disturbances and improved computational efficiency compared to existing methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[CrossVid: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Evaluating Cross-Video Reasoning in Multimodal Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12263v1)** | 2025-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cross-Video Reasoning (CVR) presents a significant challenge in video understanding, which requires simultaneous understanding of multiple videos to aggregate and compare information across groups of videos. Most existing video understanding benchmarks focus on single-video analysis, failing to assess the ability of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to simultaneously reason over various videos. Recent benchmarks evaluate MLLMs' capabilities on multi-view videos that capture different perspectives of the same scene. However, their limited tasks hinder a thorough assessment of MLLMs in diverse real-world CVR scenarios. To this end, we introduce CrossVid, the first benchmark designed to comprehensively evaluate MLLMs' spatial-temporal reasoning ability in cross-video contexts. Firstly, CrossVid encompasses a wide spectrum of hierarchical tasks, comprising four high-level dimensions and ten specific tasks, thereby closely reflecting the complex and varied nature of real-world video understanding. Secondly, CrossVid provides 5,331 videos, along with 9,015 challenging question-answering pairs, spanning single-choice, multiple-choice, and open-ended question formats. Through extensive experiments on various open-source and closed-source MLLMs, we observe that Gemini-2.5-Pro performs best on CrossVid, achieving an average accuracy of 50.4%. Notably, our in-depth case study demonstrates that most current MLLMs struggle with CVR tasks, primarily due to their inability to integrate or compare evidence distributed across multiple videos for reasoning. These insights highlight the potential of CrossVid to guide future advancements in enhancing MLLMs' CVR capabilities.</p></details> | 30 pages, 28 figures |

Yet current video benchmarks focus largely on indoor scenes or short-range outdoor activities, leaving the challenges associated with long-distance travel largely unexplored. Mastering extended geospatial-temporal trajectories is critical for next-generation MLLMs, underpinning real-world tasks such as embodied-AI planning and navigation. To bridge this gap, we present VIR-Bench, a novel benchmark consisting of 200 travel videos that frames itinerary reconstruction as a challenging task designed to evaluate and push forward MLLMs' geospatial-temporal intelligence. Experimental results reveal that state-of-the-art MLLMs, including proprietary ones, struggle to achieve high scores, underscoring the difficulty of handling videos that span extended spatial and temporal scales. Moreover, we conduct an in-depth case study in which we develop a prototype travel-planning agent that leverages the insights gained from VIR-Bench. The agent's markedly improved itinerary recommendations verify that our evaluation protocol not only benchmarks models effectively but also translates into concrete performance gains in user-facing applications.</p></details> | AAAI 2026 |

However, current models struggle with ensuring the validity and generalizability of inferred spatio-temporal patterns, especially in capturing dynamic spatial dependencies and temporal shifts, and optimizing the generalizability of unknown sensors. To overcome these limitations, we propose Spatio-Temporal Aware Graph Adversarial Neural Network (STA-GANN), a novel GNN-based kriging framework that improves spatio-temporal pattern validity and generalization. STA-GANN integrates (i) Decoupled Phase Module that senses and adjusts for timestamp shifts. (ii) Dynamic Data-Driven Metadata Graph Modeling to update spatial relationships using temporal data and metadata; (iii) An adversarial transfer learning strategy to ensure generalizability. Extensive validation across nine datasets from four fields and theoretical evidence both demonstrate the superior performance of STA-GANN.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we introduce ProAV-DiT, a Projected Latent Diffusion Transformer designed for efficient and synchronized audio-video generation. To address structural inconsistencies, we preprocess raw audio into video-like representations, aligning both the temporal and spatial dimensions between audio and video. At its core, ProAV-DiT adopts a Multi-scale Dual-stream Spatio-Temporal Autoencoder (MDSA), which projects both modalities into a unified latent space using orthogonal decomposition, enabling fine-grained spatiotemporal modeling and semantic alignment. To further enhance temporal coherence and modality-specific fusion, we introduce a multi-scale attention mechanism, which consists of multi-scale temporal self-attention and group cross-modal attention. Furthermore, we stack the 2D latents from MDSA into a unified 3D latent space, which is processed by a spatio-temporal diffusion Transformer. This design efficiently models spatiotemporal dependencies, enabling the generation of high-fidelity synchronized audio-video content while reducing computational overhead. Extensive experiments conducted on standard benchmarks demonstrate that ProAV-DiT outperforms existing methods in both generation quality and computational efficiency.</p></details> |  |

The framework organizes narrative content across three levels-panel, event, and macro-event, by integrating symbolic graphs that encode semantic, spatial, and temporal relationships. At the panel level, it models visual elements such as characters, objects, and actions alongside textual components including dialogue and narration. These are systematically connected to higher-level graphs that capture narrative sequences and abstract story structures. Applied to a manually annotated subset of the Manga109 dataset, the framework supports interpretable symbolic reasoning across four representative tasks: action retrieval, dialogue tracing, character appearance mapping, and timeline reconstruction. Rather than prioritizing predictive performance, the system emphasizes transparency in narrative modeling and enables structured inference aligned with cognitive theories of event segmentation and visual storytelling. This work contributes to explainable narrative analysis and offers a foundation for authoring tools, narrative comprehension systems, and interactive media applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Updat...</summary><p>Updated with the ICIDS 2025 camera-ready version.

| **[TIMERIPPLE: Accelerating vDiTs by Understanding the Spatio-Temporal Correlations in Latent Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12035v1)** | 2025-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent surge in video generation has shown the growing demand for high-quality video synthesis using large vision models. Existing video generation models are predominantly based on the video diffusion transformer (vDiT), however, they suffer from substantial inference delay due to self-attention. While prior studies have focused on reducing redundant computations in self-attention, they often overlook the inherent spatio-temporal correlations in video streams and directly leverage sparsity patterns from large language models to reduce attention computations. In this work, we take a principled approach to accelerate self-attention in vDiTs by leveraging the spatio-temporal correlations in the latent space. We show that the attention patterns within vDiT are primarily due to the dominant spatial and temporal correlations at the token channel level. Based on this insight, we propose a lightweight and adaptive reuse strategy that approximates attention computations by reusing partial attention scores of spatially or temporally correlated tokens along individual channels. We demonstrate that our method achieves significantly higher computational savings (85\%) compared to state-of-the-art techniques over 4 vDiTs, while preserving almost identical video quality ($<$0.06\% loss on VBench).</p></details> |  |
| **[Novelty and Impact of Economics Papers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01211v3)** | 2025-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a framework that recasts scientific novelty not as a single attribute of a paper, but as a reflection of its position within the evolving intellectual landscape. We decompose this position into two orthogonal dimensions: \textit{spatial novelty}, which measures a paper's intellectual distinctiveness from its neighbors, and \textit{temporal novelty}, which captures its engagement with a dynamic research frontier. To operationalize these concepts, we leverage Large Language Models to develop semantic isolation metrics that quantify a paper's location relative to the full-text literature. Applying this framework to a large corpus of economics articles, we uncover a fundamental trade-off: these two dimensions predict systematically different outcomes. Temporal novelty primarily predicts citation counts, whereas spatial novelty predicts disruptive impact. This distinction allows us to construct a typology of semantic neighborhoods, identifying four archetypes associated with distinct and predictable impact profiles. Our findings demonstrate that novelty can be understood as a multidimensional construct whose different forms, reflecting a paper's strategic location, have measurable and fundamentally distinct consequences for scientific progress.</p></details> |  |

TAPIP3D represents videos as camera-stabilized spatio-temporal feature clouds, leveraging depth and camera motion information to lift 2D video features into a 3D world space where camera movement is effectively canceled out. Within this stabilized 3D representation, TAPIP3D iteratively refines multi-frame motion estimates, enabling robust point tracking over long time horizons. To handle the irregular structure of 3D point distributions, we propose a 3D Neighborhood-to-Neighborhood (N2N) attention mechanism - a 3D-aware contextualization strategy that builds informative, spatially coherent feature neighborhoods to support precise trajectory estimation. Our 3D-centric formulation significantly improves performance over existing 3D point tracking methods and even surpasses state-of-the-art 2D pixel trackers in accuracy when reliable depth is available. The model supports inference in both camera-centric (unstabilized) and world-centric (stabilized) coordinates, with experiments showing that compensating for camera motion leads to substantial gains in tracking robustness. By replacing the conventional 2D square correlation windows used in prior 2D and 3D trackers with a spatially grounded 3D attention mechanism, TAPIP3D achieves strong and consistent results across multiple 3D point tracking benchmarks.

Recognizing actions in videos requires both spatial and temporal understanding, yet most existing models lack a balanced spatio-temporal understanding of videos. To address this, we propose a novel two-stream architecture, called Cross-Attention in Space and Time (CAST), using only RGB input. In each layer of CAST, Bottleneck Cross-Attention (B-CA) enables spatial and temporal experts to exchange information and make synergistic predictions. For holistic video understanding, we extend CAST by integrating an audio expert, forming Cross-Attention in Visual and Audio (CAVA). We validate the CAST on benchmarks with different characteristics, EPIC-KITCHENS-100, Something-Something-V2, and Kinetics-400, consistently showing balanced performance. We also validate the CAVA on audio-visual action recognition benchmarks, including UCF-101, VGG-Sound, KineticsSound, and EPIC-SOUNDS. With a favorable performance of CAVA across these datasets, we demonstrate the effective information exchange among multiple experts within the B-CA module. In summary, CA^2ST combines CAST and CAVA by employing spatial, temporal, and audio experts through cross-attention, achieving balanced and holistic video understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>Our p...</summary><p>Our paper has been accepted to IEEE TPAMI</p></details> |

We present Frame-to-Outcome (F2O), an end-to-end system that translates tissue dissection videos into gesture sequences and uncovers patterns associated with postoperative outcomes. Leveraging transformer-based spatial and temporal modeling and frame-wise classification, F2O robustly detects consecutive short (~2 seconds) gestures in the nerve-sparing step of robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (AUC: 0.80 frame-level; 0.81 video-level). F2O-derived features (gesture frequency, duration, and transitions) predicted postoperative outcomes with accuracy comparable to human annotations (0.79 vs. 0.75; overlapping 95% CI). Across 25 shared features, effect size directions were concordant with small differences (~ 0.07), and strong correlation (r = 0.96, p < 1e-14). F2O also captured key patterns linked to erectile function recovery, including prolonged tissue peeling and reduced energy use. By enabling automatic interpretable assessment, F2O establishes a foundation for data-driven surgical feedback and prospective clinical decision support.</p></details> |  |
| **[Transformers vs. Recurrent Models for Estimating Forest Gross Primary Production](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11880v1)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Monitoring the spatiotemporal dynamics of forest CO$_2$ uptake (Gross Primary Production, GPP), remains a central challenge in terrestrial ecosystem research. While Eddy Covariance (EC) towers provide high-frequency estimates, their limited spatial coverage constrains large-scale assessments. Remote sensing offers a scalable alternative, yet most approaches rely on single-sensor spectral indices and statistical models that are often unable to capture the complex temporal dynamics of GPP. Recent advances in deep learning (DL) and data fusion offer new opportunities to better represent the temporal dynamics of vegetation processes, but comparative evaluations of state-of-the-art DL models for multimodal GPP prediction remain scarce. Here, we explore the performance of two representative models for predicting GPP: 1) GPT-2, a transformer architecture, and 2) Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), a recurrent neural network, using multivariate inputs. Overall, both achieve similar accuracy. But, while LSTM performs better overall, GPT-2 excels during extreme events. Analysis of temporal context length further reveals that LSTM attains similar accuracy using substantially shorter input windows than GPT-2, highlighting an accuracy-efficiency trade-off between the two architectures. Feature importance analysis reveals radiation as the dominant predictor, followed by Sentinel-2, MODIS land surface temperature, and Sentinel-1 contributions. Our results demonstrate how model architecture, context length, and multimodal inputs jointly determine performance in GPP prediction, guiding future developments of DL frameworks for monitoring terrestrial carbon dynamics.</p></details> |  |

This paradigm, known as {shared autonomy}, enables autonomous vehicle and remote human operators to jointly formulate appropriate responses. To address critical decision timing with variable latency due to wireless network delays and human response time, we present LAVQA, a latency-aware shared autonomy framework that integrates Visual Question Answering (VQA) and spatiotemporal risk visualization. LAVQA augments visual queries with Latency-Induced COllision Map (LICOM), a dynamically evolving map that represents both temporal latency and spatial uncertainty. It enables remote operator to observe as the vehicle safety regions vary over time in the presence of dynamic obstacles and delayed responses. Closed-loop simulations in CARLA, the de-facto standard for autonomous vehicle simulator, suggest that that LAVQA can reduce collision rates by over 8x compared to latency-agnostic baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive LiDAR Scanning: Harnessing Temporal Cues for Efficient 3D Object Detection via Multi-Modal Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01562v2)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-sensor fusion using LiDAR and RGB cameras significantly enhances 3D object detection task. However, conventional LiDAR sensors perform dense, stateless scans, ignoring the strong temporal continuity in real-world scenes. This leads to substantial sensing redundancy and excessive power consumption, limiting their practicality on resource-constrained platforms. To address this inefficiency, we propose a predictive, history-aware adaptive scanning framework that anticipates informative regions of interest (ROI) based on past observations. Our approach introduces a lightweight predictor network that distills historical spatial and temporal contexts into refined query embeddings. These embeddings guide a differentiable Mask Generator network, which leverages Gumbel-Softmax sampling to produce binary masks identifying critical ROIs for the upcoming frame. Our method significantly reduces unnecessary data acquisition by concentrating dense LiDAR scanning only within these ROIs and sparsely sampling elsewhere. Experiments on nuScenes and Lyft benchmarks demonstrate that our adaptive scanning strategy reduces LiDAR energy consumption by over 65% while maintaining competitive or even superior 3D object detection performance compared to traditional LiDAR-camera fusion methods with dense LiDAR scanning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI), 2026</p></details> |

Unlike conventional motion planning problems, which reason over temporal sequences of states, coverage motion planning requires reasoning over the spatial distribution of entire trajectories, making standard motion planning methods limited in computational efficiency and less amenable to modern parallelization frameworks. In this work, we formulate the coverage motion planning problem as a statistical inference problem from the perspective of flow matching, a generative modeling technique that has gained significant attention in recent years. The proposed formulation unifies commonly used statistical discrepancy measures, such as Kullback-Leibler divergence and Sinkhorn divergence, with a standard linear quadratic regulator problem. More importantly, it decouples the generation of trajectory gradients for coverage from the synthesis of control under nonlinear system dynamics, enabling significant acceleration through parallelization on modern computational architectures, particularly Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). This paper focuses on the advantages of this formulation in terms of scalability through parallelization, highlighting its computational benefits compared to conventional methods based on waypoint tracking.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at the "Workshop on Fast Motion Planning and Control in the Era of Parallelism" at Robotics: Science and Systems 2025.

We formulate MoCap-to-spectrogram translation as a windowed sequence-to-sequence task using a transformer-based model that jointly captures spatial relations among MoCap markers and temporal dynamics across frames. Real-world experiments show that the proposed approach produces visually and quantitatively plausible doppler radar spectrograms and achieves good generalizability. Ablation experiments show that the learned model includes both the ability to convert multi-part motion into doppler signatures and an understanding of the spatial relations between different parts of the human body. The result is an interesting example of using transformers for time-series signal processing. It is especially applicable to edge computing and Internet of Things (IoT) radars. It also suggests the ability to augment scarce radar datasets using more abundant MoCap data for training higher-level applications. Finally, it requires far less computation than physics-based methods for generating radar data.</p></details> |  |
| **[RiverScope: High-Resolution River Masking Dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02451v2)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Surface water dynamics play a critical role in Earth's climate system, influencing ecosystems, agriculture, disaster resilience, and sustainable development. Yet monitoring rivers and surface water at fine spatial and temporal scales remains challenging -- especially for narrow or sediment-rich rivers that are poorly captured by low-resolution satellite data. To address this, we introduce RiverScope, a high-resolution dataset developed through collaboration between computer science and hydrology experts. RiverScope comprises 1,145 high-resolution images (covering 2,577 square kilometers) with expert-labeled river and surface water masks, requiring over 100 hours of manual annotation. Each image is co-registered with Sentinel-2, SWOT, and the SWOT River Database (SWORD), enabling the evaluation of cost-accuracy trade-offs across sensors -- a key consideration for operational water monitoring. We also establish the first global, high-resolution benchmark for river width estimation, achieving a median error of 7.2 meters -- significantly outperforming existing satellite-derived methods. We extensively evaluate deep networks across multiple architectures (e.g., CNNs and transformers), pretraining strategies (e.g., supervised and self-supervised), and training datasets (e.g., ImageNet and satellite imagery). Our best-performing models combine the benefits of transfer learning with the use of all the multispectral PlanetScope channels via learned adaptors. RiverScope provides a valuable resource for fine-scale and multi-sensor hydrological modeling, supporting climate adaptation and sustainable water management.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reverberation: Learning the Latencies Before Forecasting Trajectories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11164v1)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bridging the past to the future, connecting agents both spatially and temporally, lies at the core of the trajectory prediction task. Despite great efforts, it remains challenging to explicitly learn and predict latencies, the temporal delays with which agents respond to different trajectory-changing events and adjust their future paths, whether on their own or interactively. Different agents may exhibit distinct latency preferences for noticing, processing, and reacting to any specific trajectory-changing event. The lack of consideration of such latencies may undermine the causal continuity of the forecasting system and also lead to implausible or unintended trajectories. Inspired by the reverberation curves in acoustics, we propose a new reverberation transform and the corresponding Reverberation (short for Rev) trajectory prediction model, which simulates and predicts different latency preferences of each agent as well as their stochasticity by using two explicit and learnable reverberation kernels, allowing for the controllable trajectory prediction based on these forecasted latencies. Experiments on multiple datasets, whether pedestrians or vehicles, demonstrate that Rev achieves competitive accuracy while revealing interpretable latency dynamics across agents and scenarios. Qualitative analyses further verify the properties of the proposed reverberation transform, highlighting its potential as a general latency modeling approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Toward Generalized Detection of Synthetic Media: Limitations, Challenges, and the Path to Multimodal Solutions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11116v1)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Artificial intelligence (AI) in media has advanced rapidly over the last decade. The introduction of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) improved the quality of photorealistic image generation. Diffusion models later brought a new era of generative media. These advances made it difficult to separate real and synthetic content. The rise of deepfakes demonstrated how these tools could be misused to spread misinformation, political conspiracies, privacy violations, and fraud. For this reason, many detection models have been developed. They often use deep learning methods such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs). These models search for visual, spatial, or temporal anomalies. However, such approaches often fail to generalize across unseen data and struggle with content from different models. In addition, existing approaches are ineffective in multimodal data and highly modified content. This study reviews twenty-four recent works on AI-generated media detection. Each study was examined individually to identify its contributions and weaknesses, respectively. The review then summarizes the common limitations and key challenges faced by current approaches. Based on this analysis, a research direction is suggested with a focus on multimodal deep learning models. Such models have the potential to provide more robust and generalized detection. It offers future researchers a clear starting point for building stronger defenses against harmful synthetic media.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 Pa...</summary><p>10 Pages, 4 figures, 1 table, 7th International Conference on Trends in Computational and Cognitive Engineering(TCCE-2025)</p></details> |

A major challenge is workload interference on shared network links. Parallel discrete event simulation (PDES) is commonly used to analyze workload interference. However, high-fidelity PDES is computationally expensive, making it impractical for large-scale or real-time scenarios. Hybrid simulation that incorporates data-driven surrogate models offers a promising alternative, especially for forecasting application runtime, a task complicated by the dynamic behavior of network traffic. We present \ourmodel, a surrogate model that combines graph neural networks (GNNs) and large language models (LLMs) to capture both spatial and temporal patterns from port level router data. \ourmodel outperforms existing statistical and machine learning baselines, enabling accurate runtime prediction and supporting efficient hybrid simulation of Dragonfly networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AAAI 2026</p></details> |
| **[AccKV: Towards Efficient Audio-Video LLMs Inference via Adaptive-Focusing and Cross-Calibration KV Cache Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11106v1)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in Audio-Video Large Language Models (AV-LLMs) have enhanced their capabilities in tasks like audio-visual question answering and multimodal dialog systems. Video and audio introduce an extended temporal dimension, resulting in a larger key-value (KV) cache compared to static image embedding. A naive optimization strategy is to selectively focus on and retain KV caches of audio or video based on task. However, in the experiment, we observed that the attention of AV-LLMs to various modalities in the high layers is not strictly dependent on the task. In higher layers, the attention of AV-LLMs shifts more towards the video modality. In addition, we also found that directly integrating temporal KV of audio and spatial-temporal KV of video may lead to information confusion and significant performance degradation of AV-LLMs. If audio and video are processed indiscriminately, it may also lead to excessive compression or reservation of a certain modality, thereby disrupting the alignment between modalities. To address these challenges, we propose AccKV, an Adaptive-Focusing and Cross-Calibration KV cache optimization framework designed specifically for efficient AV-LLMs inference. Our method is based on layer adaptive focusing technology, selectively focusing on key modalities according to the characteristics of different layers, and enhances the recognition of heavy hitter tokens through attention redistribution. In addition, we propose a Cross-Calibration technique that first integrates inefficient KV caches within the audio and video modalities, and then aligns low-priority modalities with high-priority modalities to selectively evict KV cache of low-priority modalities. The experimental results show that AccKV can significantly improve the computational efficiency of AV-LLMs while maintaining accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Strada-LLM: Graph LLM for traffic prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20856v3)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic forecasting is pivotal for intelligent transportation systems, where accurate and interpretable predictions can significantly enhance operational efficiency and safety. A key challenge stems from the heterogeneity of traffic conditions across diverse locations, leading to highly varied traffic data distributions. Large language models (LLMs) show exceptional promise for few-shot learning in such dynamic and data-sparse scenarios. However, existing LLM-based solutions often rely on prompt-tuning, which can struggle to fully capture complex graph relationships and spatiotemporal dependencies-thereby limiting adaptability and interpretability in real-world traffic networks. We address these gaps by introducing Strada-LLM, a novel multivariate probabilistic forecasting LLM that explicitly models both temporal and spatial traffic patterns. By incorporating proximal traffic information as covariates, Strada-LLM more effectively captures local variations and outperforms prompt-based existing LLMs. To further enhance adaptability, we propose a lightweight distribution-derived strategy for domain adaptation, enabling parameter-efficient model updates when encountering new data distributions or altered network topologies-even under few-shot constraints. Empirical evaluations on spatio-temporal transportation datasets demonstrate that Strada-LLM consistently surpasses state-of-the-art LLM-driven and traditional GNN-based predictors. Specifically, it improves long-term forecasting by 17% in RMSE error and 16% more efficiency. Moreover, it maintains robust performance across different LLM backbones with minimal degradation, making it a versatile and powerful solution for real-world traffic prediction tasks.</p></details> | 13 pages |
| **[A Space-Time Transformer for Precipitation Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11090v1)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Meteorological agencies around the world rely on real-time flood guidance to issue live-saving advisories and warnings. For decades traditional numerical weather prediction (NWP) models have been state-of-the-art for precipitation forecasting. However, physically-parameterized models suffer from a few core limitations: first, solving PDEs to resolve atmospheric dynamics is computationally demanding, and second, these methods degrade in performance at nowcasting timescales (i.e., 0-4 hour lead-times). Motivated by these shortcomings, recent work proposes AI-weather prediction (AI-WP) alternatives that learn to emulate analysis data with neural networks. While these data-driven approaches have enjoyed enormous success across diverse spatial and temporal resolutions, applications of video-understanding architectures for weather forecasting remain underexplored. To address these gaps, we propose SaTformer: a video transformer built on full space-time attention that skillfully forecasts extreme precipitation from satellite radiances. Along with our novel architecture, we introduce techniques to tame long-tailed precipitation datasets. Namely, we reformulate precipitation regression into a classification problem, and employ a class-weighted loss to address label imbalances. Our model scored first place on the NeurIPS Weather4Cast 2025 Cumulative Rainfall challenge. Code and model weights are available: https://github.com/leharris3/satformer</p></details> |  |

Existing SSL approaches such as contrastive, masked modeling, and clustering-based methods struggle with high intersample similarity, sensitivity to low PSNR inputs common in ultrasound, or aggressive augmentations that distort clinically relevant features. We present DISCOVR (Distilled Image Supervision for Cross Modal Video Representation), a self-supervised dual branch framework for cardiac ultrasound video representation learning. DISCOVR combines a clustering-based video encoder that models temporal dynamics with an online image encoder that extracts fine-grained spatial semantics. These branches are connected through a semantic cluster distillation loss that transfers anatomical knowledge from the evolving image encoder to the video encoder, enabling temporally coherent representations enriched with fine-grained semantic understanding.Evaluated on six echocardiography datasets spanning fetal, pediatric, and adult populations, DISCOVR outperforms both specialized video anomaly detection methods and state-of-the-art video-SSL baselines in zero-shot and linear probing setups,achieving superior segmentation transfer and strong downstream performance on clinically relevant tasks such as LVEF prediction.

| **[EMOD: A Unified EEG Emotion Representation Framework Leveraging V-A Guided Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05863v2)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Emotion recognition from EEG signals is essential for affective computing and has been widely explored using deep learning. While recent deep learning approaches have achieved strong performance on single EEG emotion datasets, their generalization across datasets remains limited due to the heterogeneity in annotation schemes and data formats. Existing models typically require dataset-specific architectures tailored to input structure and lack semantic alignment across diverse emotion labels. To address these challenges, we propose EMOD: A Unified EEG Emotion Representation Framework Leveraging Valence-Arousal (V-A) Guided Contrastive Learning. EMOD learns transferable and emotion-aware representations from heterogeneous datasets by bridging both semantic and structural gaps. Specifically, we project discrete and continuous emotion labels into a unified V-A space and formulate a soft-weighted supervised contrastive loss that encourages emotionally similar samples to cluster in the latent space. To accommodate variable EEG formats, EMOD employs a flexible backbone comprising a Triple-Domain Encoder followed by a Spatial-Temporal Transformer, enabling robust extraction and integration of temporal, spectral, and spatial features. We pretrain EMOD on 8 public EEG datasets and evaluate its performance on three benchmark datasets. Experimental results show that EMOD achieves the state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating strong adaptability and generalization across diverse EEG-based emotion recognition scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Although emotion analysis has made progress in the visual domain, the video community lacks dedicated resources to bridge emotion understanding with generative tasks, particularly for stylized and non-realistic contexts. To address this gap, we introduce EmoVid, the first multimodal, emotion-annotated video dataset specifically designed for creative media, which includes cartoon animations, movie clips, and animated stickers. Each video is annotated with emotion labels, visual attributes (brightness, colorfulness, hue), and text captions. Through systematic analysis, we uncover spatial and temporal patterns linking visual features to emotional perceptions across diverse video forms. Building on these insights, we develop an emotion-conditioned video generation technique by fine-tuning the Wan2.1 model. The results show a significant improvement in both quantitative metrics and the visual quality of generated videos for text-to-video and image-to-video tasks. EmoVid establishes a new benchmark for affective video computing. Our work not only offers valuable insights into visual emotion analysis in artistically styled videos, but also provides practical methods for enhancing emotional expression in video generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 12 figures.

Existing methods primarily employ LLM for high-level planning to decompose a story into scene-level descriptions, which are then independently generated and stitched together. However, these approaches struggle with generating high-quality videos aligned with the complex single-scene description, as visualizing such complex description involves coherent composition of multiple characters and events, complex motion synthesis and multi-character customization. To address these challenges, we propose DREAMRUNNER, a novel story-to-video generation method: First, we structure the input script using a large language model (LLM) to facilitate both coarse-grained scene planning as well as fine-grained object-level layout planning. Next, DREAMRUNNER presents retrieval-augmented test-time adaptation to capture target motion priors for objects in each scene, supporting diverse motion customization based on retrieved videos, thus facilitating the generation of new videos with complex, scripted motions. Lastly, we propose a novel spatial-temporal region-based 3D attention and prior injection module SR3AI for fine-grained object-motion binding and frame-by-frame spatial-temporal semantic control. We compare DREAMRUNNER with various SVG baselines, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in character consistency, text alignment, and smooth transitions. Additionally, DREAMRUNNER exhibits strong fine-grained condition-following ability in compositional text-to-video generation, significantly outperforming baselines on T2V-ComBench. Finally, we validate DREAMRUNNER's robust ability to generate multi-object interactions with qualitative examples.</p></details> | <details><summary>AAAI ...</summary><p>AAAI 2026, Project website: https://zunwang1.github.io/DreamRunner</p></details> |

In this context, the integration of electroencephalography (EEG) and electromyography (EMG) signals offers strong potential for enhancing decoding performance. Mandarin tone classification presents particular challenges, as tonal variations convey distinct meanings even when phonemes remain identical. In this study, we propose a novel cross-subject multimodal BCI decoding framework that fuses EEG and EMG signals to classify four Mandarin tones under both audible and silent speech conditions. Inspired by the cooperative mechanisms of neural and muscular systems in speech production, our neural decoding architecture combines spatial-temporal feature extraction branches with a cross-attention fusion mechanism, enabling informative interaction between modalities. We further incorporate domain-adversarial training to improve cross-subject generalization. We collected 4,800 EEG trials and 4,800 EMG trials from 10 participants using only twenty EEG and five EMG channels, demonstrating the feasibility of minimal-channel decoding. Despite employing lightweight modules, our model outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across all conditions, achieving average classification accuracies of 87.83% for audible speech and 88.08% for silent speech. In cross-subject evaluations, it still maintains strong performance with accuracies of 83.27% and 85.10% for audible and silent speech, respectively. We further conduct ablation studies to validate the effectiveness of each component. Our findings suggest that tone-level decoding with minimal EEG-EMG channels is feasible and potentially generalizable across subjects, contributing to the development of practical BCI applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is the extended version with technical appendices.

Yet, applying DT to deformation-based metal forming remains challenging because of the strongly coupled spatial-temporal behavior and the nonlinear relationship between toolpath and material response. For instance, sheet-metal forming by the English wheel, a highly flexible but artisan-dependent process, still lacks digital counterparts that can autonomously plan and adapt forming strategies. This study presents an adaptive DT framework that integrates Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) for physics-aware dimensionality reduction with a Koopman operator for representing nonlinear system in a linear lifted space for the real-time decision-making via model predictive control (MPC). To accommodate evolving process conditions or material states, an online Recursive Least Squares (RLS) algorithm is introduced to update the operator coefficients in real time, enabling continuous adaptation of the DT model as new deformation data become available. The proposed framework is experimentally demonstrated on a robotic English Wheel sheet metal forming system, where deformation fields are measured and modeled under varying toolpaths. Results show that the adaptive DT is capable of controlling the forming process to achieve the given target shape by effectively capturing non-stationary process behaviors. Beyond this case study, the proposed framework establishes a generalizable approach for interpretable, adaptive, and computationally-efficient DT of nonlinear manufacturing systems, bridging reduced-order physics representations with data-driven adaptability to support autonomous process control and optimization.</p></details> |  |

While current spatial training approaches rely on real-world video data, obtaining diverse footage with precise spatial annotations remains a bottleneck. To alleviate this bottleneck, we present SIMS-V -- a systematic data-generation framework that leverages the privileged information of 3D simulators to create spatially-rich video training data for multimodal language models. Using this framework, we investigate which properties of simulated data drive effective real-world transfer through systematic ablations of question types, mixes, and scales. We identify a minimal set of three question categories (metric measurement, perspective-dependent reasoning, and temporal tracking) that prove most effective for developing transferable spatial intelligence, outperforming comprehensive coverage despite using fewer question types. These insights enable highly efficient training: our 7B-parameter video LLM fine-tuned on just 25K simulated examples outperforms the larger 72B baseline and achieves competitive performance with proprietary models on rigorous real-world spatial reasoning benchmarks. Our approach demonstrates robust generalization, maintaining performance on general video understanding while showing substantial improvements on embodied and real-world spatial tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://ellisbrown.github.io/sims-v</p></details> |

While this growth presents new opportunities, it complicates mapping global scientific research landscapes, as manual review methods become infeasible. Recent advancements in machine learning, complex networks, and natural language processing have enabled numerous data-driven discovery methods. Building upon these tools, we introduce an end-to-end workflow for analyzing large-scale literature landscapes, LitLA. This workflow first integrates diverse publication metadata into a bibliographic knowledge graph (KG) representing the research landscape. It then offers tools for exploratory analysis of various landscape aspects. We demonstrate the effectiveness of LitLA via a case study on follow-up works of multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition (MOEA/D). In doing so, we constructed the MOEA/D research landscape as a KG comprising over 5,400 papers, 10,000 authors, 1,600 institutions, and 78,000 keywords. With this landscape, we start with descriptive statistics and investigate prominent topics pertaining to MOEA/D and interrogate their spatial-temporal and bilateral relationships. We then map the collaboration and citation networks to reveal the community's growth over time. We further experiment whether learning on latent patterns of this landscape can hint on future research directions.</p></details> |  |

This paper develops and applies a Bayesian hierarchical model to analyze U.S. county-level mortality and suicide rates from 2010 to 2023. Applying a conditional autoregressive (CAR) structure to each combination of sex and age grouping, the model captures spatial and temporal trends while incorporating mental health surveillance data and socio-economic indicators. We first assess socio-economic covariates in predicting suicide. While the results vary considerably by age and sex, we find that the county-wide levels of educational attainment, housing prices, marriage rates, racial composition, household size, and poor mental health days all have significant relationships with suicide rates. We next consider the impact of various mental health indicators on all-cause and suicide-specific mortality and find that the strongest effects are observed in younger populations. The spatial and temporal correlation structures reveal substantial regional clustering and time-consistent trends in both all-cause mortality and suicide rates, supporting the use of spatio-temporal methods. Our findings highlight the value of integrating mental health surveillance data into mortality models to better identify emerging risk areas and vulnerable populations.

However, the distributed nature of real-world traffic data across multiple stakeholders poses significant challenges in modeling and reconstructing inter-client spatial dependencies while adhering to data locality constraints. Existing methods primarily address static dependencies, overlooking their dynamic nature and resulting in suboptimal performance. In response, we propose Federated Spatio-Temporal Graph with Dynamic Inter-Client Dependencies (FedSTGD), a framework designed to model and reconstruct dynamic inter-client spatial dependencies in federated learning. FedSTGD incorporates a federated nonlinear computation decomposition module to approximate complex graph operations. This is complemented by a graph node embedding augmentation module, which alleviates performance degradation arising from the decomposition. These modules are coordinated through a client-server collective learning protocol, which decomposes dynamic inter-client spatial dependency learning tasks into lightweight, parallelizable subtasks. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that FedSTGD achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art baselines in terms of RMSE, MAE, and MAPE, approaching that of centralized baselines. Ablation studies confirm the contribution of each module in addressing dynamic inter-client spatial dependencies, while sensitivity analysis highlights the robustness of FedSTGD to variations in hyperparameters.</p></details> |  |

However, evaluating LLMs across diverse urban tasks faces two critical challenges: lack of unified platforms for consistent multi-source data access and fragmented task definitions that hinder fair comparison. To address these challenges, we present CityVerse, the first unified platform integrating multi-source urban data, capability-based task taxonomy, and dynamic simulation for systematic LLM evaluation in urban contexts. CityVerse provides: 1) coordinate-based Data APIs unifying ten categories of urban data-including spatial features, temporal dynamics, demographics, and multi-modal imagery-with over 38 million curated records; 2) Task APIs organizing 43 urban computing tasks into a four-level cognitive hierarchy: Perception, Spatial Understanding, Reasoning and Prediction, and Decision and Interaction, enabling standardized evaluation across capability levels; 3) an interactive visualization frontend supporting real-time data retrieval, multi-layer display, and simulation replay for intuitive exploration and validation. We validate the platform's effectiveness through evaluations on mainstream LLMs across representative tasks, demonstrating its capability to support reproducible and systematic assessment. CityVerse provides a reusable foundation for advancing LLMs and multi-task approaches in the urban computing domain.</p></details> |  |
| **[TubeRMC: Tube-conditioned Reconstruction with Mutual Constraints for Weakly-supervised Spatio-Temporal Video Grounding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10241v1)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-Temporal Video Grounding (STVG) aims to localize a spatio-temporal tube that corresponds to a given language query in an untrimmed video. This is a challenging task since it involves complex vision-language understanding and spatiotemporal reasoning. Recent works have explored weakly-supervised setting in STVG to eliminate reliance on fine-grained annotations like bounding boxes or temporal stamps. However, they typically follow a simple late-fusion manner, which generates tubes independent of the text description, often resulting in failed target identification and inconsistent target tracking. To address this limitation, we propose a Tube-conditioned Reconstruction with Mutual Constraints (\textbf{TubeRMC}) framework that generates text-conditioned candidate tubes with pre-trained visual grounding models and further refine them via tube-conditioned reconstruction with spatio-temporal constraints. Specifically, we design three reconstruction strategies from temporal, spatial, and spatio-temporal perspectives to comprehensively capture rich tube-text correspondences. Each strategy is equipped with a Tube-conditioned Reconstructor, utilizing spatio-temporal tubes as condition to reconstruct the key clues in the query. We further introduce mutual constraints between spatial and temporal proposals to enhance their quality for reconstruction. TubeRMC outperforms existing methods on two public benchmarks VidSTG and HCSTVG. Further visualization shows that TubeRMC effectively mitigates both target identification errors and inconsistent tracking.</p></details> |  |
| **[Movement-Specific Analysis for FIM Score Classification Using Spatio-Temporal Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10713v1)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The functional independence measure (FIM) is widely used to evaluate patients' physical independence in activities of daily living. However, traditional FIM assessment imposes a significant burden on both patients and healthcare professionals. To address this challenge, we propose an automated FIM score estimation method that utilizes simple exercises different from the designated FIM assessment actions. Our approach employs a deep neural network architecture integrating a spatial-temporal graph convolutional network (ST-GCN), bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM), and an attention mechanism to estimate FIM motor item scores. The model effectively captures long-term temporal dependencies and identifies key body-joint contributions through learned attention weights. We evaluated our method in a study of 277 rehabilitation patients, focusing on FIM transfer and locomotion items. Our approach successfully distinguishes between completely independent patients and those requiring assistance, achieving balanced accuracies of 70.09-78.79 % across different FIM items. Additionally, our analysis reveals specific movement patterns that serve as reliable predictors for particular FIM evaluation items.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures, 3tables, Accepted for the 2026 IEEE/SICE International Symposium on System Integration (SII 2026), January 11-14, 2026, Cancun, Mexico</p></details> |
| **[Dolphin: An Actor-Oriented Database for Reactive Moving Object Data Management](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10063v1)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Novel reactive moving object applications require solutions to support object reactive behaviors as a way to query and update dynamic data. While moving object scenarios have long been researched in the context of spatio-temporal data management, reactive behavior is usually left to complex end-user implementations. However, it is not just a matter of hardwiring reactive constraints: the required solutions need to satisfy tight low-latency computation requirements and be scalable. This paper explores a novel approach to enrich a distributed actor-based framework with reactive functionality and complex spatial data management along with concurrency semantics. Our approach relies on a proposal of the moving actor abstraction, which is a conceptual enhancement of the actor model with reactive sensing, movement, and spatial querying capabilities. This enhancement helps developers of reactive moving object applications avoid the significant burden of implementing application-level schemes to balance performance and consistency. Based on moving actors, we define a reactive moving object data management platform, named Moving Actor-Oriented Databases (M-AODBs), and build Dolphin -- an implementation of M-AODBs. Dolphin embodies a non-intrusive actor-based design layered on top of the Microsoft Orleans distributed virtual actor framework. In a set of experimental evaluations with realistic reactive moving object scenarios, Dolphin exhibits scalability on multi-machines and provides near-real-time reaction latency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multivariate Gaussian Representation Learning for Medical Action Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10060v1)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine-grained action evaluation in medical vision faces unique challenges due to the unavailability of comprehensive datasets, stringent precision requirements, and insufficient spatiotemporal dynamic modeling of very rapid actions. To support development and evaluation, we introduce CPREval-6k, a multi-view, multi-label medical action benchmark containing 6,372 expert-annotated videos with 22 clinical labels. Using this dataset, we present GaussMedAct, a multivariate Gaussian encoding framework, to advance medical motion analysis through adaptive spatiotemporal representation learning. Multivariate Gaussian Representation projects the joint motions to a temporally scaled multi-dimensional space, and decomposes actions into adaptive 3D Gaussians that serve as tokens. These tokens preserve motion semantics through anisotropic covariance modeling while maintaining robustness to spatiotemporal noise. Hybrid Spatial Encoding, employing a Cartesian and Vector dual-stream strategy, effectively utilizes skeletal information in the form of joint and bone features. The proposed method achieves 92.1% Top-1 accuracy with real-time inference on the benchmark, outperforming the ST-GCN baseline by +5.9% accuracy with only 10% FLOPs. Cross-dataset experiments confirm the superiority of our method in robustness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2026</p></details> |
| **[DarkFarseer: Robust Spatio-temporal Kriging under Graph Sparsity and Noise](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02808v2)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid growth of the Internet of Things and Cyber-Physical Systems, widespread sensor deployment has become essential. However, the high costs of building sensor networks limit their scale and coverage, making fine-grained deployment challenging. Inductive Spatio-Temporal Kriging (ISK) addresses this issue by introducing virtual sensors. Based on graph neural networks (GNNs) extracting the relationships between physical and virtual sensors, ISK can infer the measurements of virtual sensors from physical sensors. However, current ISK methods rely on conventional message-passing mechanisms and network architectures, without effectively extracting spatio-temporal features of physical sensors and focusing on representing virtual sensors. Additionally, existing graph construction methods face issues of sparse and noisy connections, destroying ISK performance. To address these issues, we propose DarkFarseer, a novel ISK framework with three key components. First, we propose the Neighbor Hidden Style Enhancement module with a style transfer strategy to enhance the representation of virtual nodes in a temporal-then-spatial manner to better extract the spatial relationships between physical and virtual nodes. Second, we propose Virtual-Component Contrastive Learning, which aims to enrich the node representation by establishing the association between the patterns of virtual nodes and the regional patterns within graph components. Lastly, we design a Similarity-Based Graph Denoising Strategy, which reduces the connectivity strength of noisy connections around virtual nodes and their neighbors based on their temporal information and regional spatial patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DarkFarseer significantly outperforms existing ISK methods.</p></details> | Accepted by AAAI'26 |
| **[Modeling Spatio-Temporal Transport: From Rigid Advection to Realistic Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.02756v3)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Stochastic models for spatio-temporal transport face a critical trade-off between physical realism and interpretability. The advection model with a single constant velocity is interpretable but physically limited by its perfect correlation over time. This work aims to bridge the gap between this simple framework and its physically realistic extensions. Our guiding principle is to introduce a spatial correlation structure that vanishes over time. To achieve this, we present two distinct approaches. The first constructs complex velocity structures, either through superpositions of advection components or by allowing the velocity to vary locally. The second is a spectral technique that replaces the singular spectrum of rigid advection with a more flexible form, introducing temporal decorrelation controlled by parameters. We accompany these models with efficient simulation algorithms and demonstrate their success in replicating complex dynamics, such as tropical cyclones and the solutions of partial differential equations.</p></details> |  |
| **[KoopMotion: Learning Almost Divergence Free Koopman Flow Fields for Motion Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09074v2)** | 2025-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we propose a novel flow field-based motion planning method that drives a robot from any initial state to a desired reference trajectory such that it converges to the trajectory's end point. Despite demonstrated efficacy in using Koopman operator theory for modeling dynamical systems, Koopman does not inherently enforce convergence to desired trajectories nor to specified goals - a requirement when learning from demonstrations (LfD). We present KoopMotion which represents motion flow fields as dynamical systems, parameterized by Koopman Operators to mimic desired trajectories, and leverages the divergence properties of the learnt flow fields to obtain smooth motion fields that converge to a desired reference trajectory when a robot is placed away from the desired trajectory, and tracks the trajectory until the end point. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we show evaluations of KoopMotion on the LASA human handwriting dataset and a 3D manipulator end-effector trajectory dataset, including spectral analysis. We also perform experiments on a physical robot, verifying KoopMotion on a miniature autonomous surface vehicle operating in a non-static fluid flow environment. Our approach is highly sample efficient in both space and time, requiring only 3\% of the LASA dataset to generate dense motion plans. Additionally, KoopMotion provides a significant improvement over baselines when comparing metrics that measure spatial and temporal dynamics modeling efficacy.

To address these limitations, we propose EvRWKV, a novel framework that enables continuous cross-modal interaction through dual-domain processing, which mainly includes a Cross-RWKV Module to capture fine-grained temporal and cross-modal dependencies, and an Event Image Spectral Fusion Enhancer (EISFE) module to perform joint adaptive frequency-domain denoising and spatial-domain alignment. This continuous interaction maintains feature consistency from low-level textures to high-level semantics. Extensive experiments on the real-world SDE and SDSD datasets demonstrate that EvRWKV significantly outperforms only image-based methods by 1.79 dB and 1.85 dB in PSNR, respectively. To further validate the practical utility of our method for downstream applications, we evaluated its impact on semantic segmentation. Experiments demonstrate that images enhanced by EvRWKV lead to a significant 35.44% improvement in mIoU.</p></details> |  |
| **[Context-Aware Multimodal Representation Learning for Spatio-Temporally Explicit Environmental modelling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11706v1)** | 2025-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Earth observation (EO) foundation models have emerged as an effective approach to derive latent representations of the Earth system from various remote sensing sensors. These models produce embeddings that can be used as analysis-ready datasets, enabling the modelling of ecosystem dynamics without extensive sensor-specific preprocessing. However, existing models typically operate at fixed spatial or temporal scales, limiting their use for ecological analyses that require both fine spatial detail and high temporal fidelity. To overcome these limitations, we propose a representation learning framework that integrates different EO modalities into a unified feature space at high spatio-temporal resolution. We introduce the framework using Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data as representative modalities. Our approach produces a latent space at native 10 m resolution and the temporal frequency of cloud-free Sentinel-2 acquisitions. Each sensor is first modeled independently to capture its sensor-specific characteristics. Their representations are then combined into a shared model. This two-stage design enables modality-specific optimisation and easy extension to new sensors, retaining pretrained encoders while retraining only fusion layers. This enables the model to capture complementary remote sensing data and to preserve coherence across space and time. Qualitative analyses reveal that the learned embeddings exhibit high spatial and semantic consistency across heterogeneous landscapes. Quantitative evaluation in modelling Gross Primary Production reveals that they encode ecologically meaningful patterns and retain sufficient temporal fidelity to support fine-scale analyses. Overall, the proposed framework provides a flexible, analysis-ready representation learning approach for environmental applications requiring diverse spatial and temporal resolutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages (incliding 2 pages of references), 7 figures</p></details> |
| **[Spatio-Temporal Graph Unlearning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09404v1)** | 2025-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal graphs are widely used in modeling complex dynamic processes such as traffic forecasting, molecular dynamics, and healthcare monitoring. Recently, stringent privacy regulations such as GDPR and CCPA have introduced significant new challenges for existing spatio-temporal graph models, requiring complete unlearning of unauthorized data. Since each node in a spatio-temporal graph diffuses information globally across both spatial and temporal dimensions, existing unlearning methods primarily designed for static graphs and localized data removal cannot efficiently erase a single node without incurring costs nearly equivalent to full model retraining. Therefore, an effective approach for complete spatio-temporal graph unlearning is a pressing need. To address this, we propose CallosumNet, a divide-and-conquer spatio-temporal graph unlearning framework inspired by the corpus callosum structure that facilitates communication between the brain's two hemispheres. CallosumNet incorporates two novel techniques: (1) Enhanced Subgraph Construction (ESC), which adaptively constructs multiple localized subgraphs based on several factors, including biologically-inspired virtual ganglions; and (2) Global Ganglion Bridging (GGB), which reconstructs global spatio-temporal dependencies from these localized subgraphs, effectively restoring the full graph representation. Empirical results on four diverse real-world datasets show that CallosumNet achieves complete unlearning with only 1%-2% relative MAE loss compared to the gold model, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. Ablation studies verify the effectiveness of both proposed techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 4 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |
