| **[Forecasting in Offline Reinforcement Learning for Non-stationary Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01987v1)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) provides a promising avenue for training policies from pre-collected datasets when gathering additional interaction data is infeasible. However, existing offline RL methods often assume stationarity or only consider synthetic perturbations at test time, assumptions that often fail in real-world scenarios characterized by abrupt, time-varying offsets. These offsets can lead to partial observability, causing agents to misperceive their true state and degrade performance. To overcome this challenge, we introduce Forecasting in Non-stationary Offline RL (FORL), a framework that unifies (i) conditional diffusion-based candidate state generation, trained without presupposing any specific pattern of future non-stationarity, and (ii) zero-shot time-series foundation models. FORL targets environments prone to unexpected, potentially non-Markovian offsets, requiring robust agent performance from the onset of each episode. Empirical evaluations on offline RL benchmarks, augmented with real-world time-series data to simulate realistic non-stationarity, demonstrate that FORL consistently improves performance compared to competitive baselines. By integrating zero-shot forecasting with the agent's experience, we aim to bridge the gap between offline RL and the complexities of real-world, non-stationary environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>The T...</summary><p>The Thirty-Ninth Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems, NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Signals, Concepts, and Laws: Toward Universal, Explainable Time-Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01407v3)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate, explainable and physically credible forecasting remains a persistent challenge for multivariate time-series whose statistical properties vary across domains. We propose DORIC, a Domain-Universal, ODE-Regularized, Interpretable-Concept Transformer for Time-Series Forecasting that generates predictions through five self-supervised, domain-agnostic concepts while enforcing differentiable residuals grounded in first-principles constraints.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Noise to Laws: Regularized Time-Series Forecasting via Denoised Dynamic Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17817v2)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long-horizon multivariate time-series forecasting is challenging because realistic predictions must (i) denoise heterogeneous signals, (ii) track time-varying cross-series dependencies, and (iii) remain stable and physically plausible over long rollout horizons. We present PRISM, which couples a score-based diffusion preconditioner with a dynamic, correlation-thresholded graph encoder and a forecast head regularized by generic physics penalties. We prove contraction of the induced horizon dynamics under mild conditions and derive Lipschitz bounds for graph blocks, explaining the model's robustness. On six standard benchmarks , PRISM achieves consistent SOTA with strong MSE and MAE gains.</p></details> |  |
| **[Conformal Prediction for Time-series Forecasting with Change Points](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02844v4)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conformal prediction has been explored as a general and efficient way to provide uncertainty quantification for time series. However, current methods struggle to handle time series data with change points - sudden shifts in the underlying data-generating process. In this paper, we propose a novel Conformal Prediction for Time-series with Change points (CPTC) algorithm, addressing this gap by integrating a model to predict the underlying state with online conformal prediction to model uncertainties in non-stationary time series. We prove CPTC's validity and improved adaptivity in the time series setting under minimum assumptions, and demonstrate CPTC's practical effectiveness on 6 synthetic and real-world datasets, showing improved validity and adaptivity compared to state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Self-explainable Model of Long Time Series by Extracting Informative Structured Causal Patterns](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01412v1)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Explainability is essential for neural networks that model long time series, yet most existing explainable AI methods only produce point-wise importance scores and fail to capture temporal structures such as trends, cycles, and regime changes. This limitation weakens human interpretability and trust in long-horizon models. To address these issues, we identify four key requirements for interpretable time-series modeling: temporal continuity, pattern-centric explanation, causal disentanglement, and faithfulness to the model's inference process. We propose EXCAP, a unified framework that satisfies all four requirements. EXCAP combines an attention-based segmenter that extracts coherent temporal patterns, a causally structured decoder guided by a pre-trained causal graph, and a latent aggregation mechanism that enforces representation stability. Our theoretical analysis shows that EXCAP provides smooth and stable explanations over time and is robust to perturbations in causal masks. Extensive experiments on classification and forecasting benchmarks demonstrate that EXCAP achieves strong predictive accuracy while generating coherent and causally grounded explanations. These results show that EXCAP offers a principled and scalable approach to interpretable modeling of long time series with relevance to high-stakes domains such as healthcare and finance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Appro...</summary><p>Approximately 30 pages, 8 figures, and 5 tables.

| **[Adaptive Nonlinear Vector Autoregression: Robust Forecasting for Noisy Chaotic Time Series](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08738v2)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Nonlinear vector autoregression (NVAR) and reservoir computing (RC) have shown promise in forecasting chaotic dynamical systems, such as the Lorenz-63 model and El Nino-Southern Oscillation. However, their reliance on fixed nonlinear transformations - polynomial expansions in NVAR or random feature maps in RC - limits their adaptability to high noise or complex real-world data. Furthermore, these methods also exhibit poor scalability in high-dimensional settings due to costly matrix inversion during optimization. We propose a data-adaptive NVAR model that combines delay-embedded linear inputs with features generated by a shallow, trainable multilayer perceptron (MLP). Unlike standard NVAR and RC models, the MLP and linear readout are jointly trained using gradient-based optimization, enabling the model to learn data-driven nonlinearities, while preserving a simple readout structure and improving scalability. Initial experiments across multiple chaotic systems, tested under noise-free and synthetically noisy conditions, showed that the adaptive model outperformed in predictive accuracy the standard NVAR, a leaky echo state network (ESN) - the most common RC model - and a hybrid ESN, thereby showing robust forecasting under noisy conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 5 figures, 5 tables.

| **[Revitalizing Canonical Pre-Alignment for Irregular Multivariate Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01971v2)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Irregular multivariate time series (IMTS), characterized by uneven sampling and inter-variate asynchrony, fuel many forecasting applications yet remain challenging to model efficiently. Canonical Pre-Alignment (CPA) has been widely adopted in IMTS modeling by padding zeros at every global timestamp, thereby alleviating inter-variate asynchrony and unifying the series length, but its dense zero-padding inflates the pre-aligned series length, especially when numerous variates are present, causing prohibitive compute overhead. Recent graph-based models with patching strategies sidestep CPA, but their local message passing struggles to capture global inter-variate correlations. Therefore, we posit that CPA should be retained, with the pre-aligned series properly handled by the model, enabling it to outperform state-of-the-art graph-based baselines that sidestep CPA. Technically, we propose KAFNet, a compact architecture grounded in CPA for IMTS forecasting that couples (1) Pre-Convolution module for sequence smoothing and sparsity mitigation, (2) Temporal Kernel Aggregation module for learnable compression and modeling of intra-series irregularity, and (3) Frequency Linear Attention blocks for the low-cost inter-series correlations modeling in the frequency domain. Experiments on multiple IMTS datasets show that KAFNet achieves state-of-the-art forecasting performance, with a 7.2$\times$ parameter reduction and a 8.4$\times$ training-inference acceleration.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026</p></details> |
| **[TimeDistill: Efficient Long-Term Time Series Forecasting with MLP via Cross-Architecture Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15016v2)** | 2025-11-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer-based and CNN-based methods demonstrate strong performance in long-term time series forecasting. However, their high computational and storage requirements can hinder large-scale deployment. To address this limitation, we propose integrating lightweight MLP with advanced architectures using knowledge distillation (KD). Our preliminary study reveals different models can capture complementary patterns, particularly multi-scale and multi-period patterns in the temporal and frequency domains. Based on this observation, we introduce TimeDistill, a cross-architecture KD framework that transfers these patterns from teacher models (e.g., Transformers, CNNs) to MLP. Additionally, we provide a theoretical analysis, demonstrating that our KD approach can be interpreted as a specialized form of mixup data augmentation. TimeDistill improves MLP performance by up to 18.6%, surpassing teacher models on eight datasets. It also achieves up to 7X faster inference and requires 130X fewer parameters. Furthermore, we conduct extensive evaluations to highlight the versatility and effectiveness of TimeDistill.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at KDD 2026, we release our code publicly at https://github.com/LingFengGold/TimeDistill</p></details> |
| **[D-CTNet: A Dual-Branch Channel-Temporal Forecasting Network with Frequency-Domain Correction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00925v1)** | 2025-11-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate Multivariate Time Series (MTS) forecasting is crucial for collaborative design of complex systems, Digital Twin building, and maintenance ahead of time. However, the collaborative industrial environment presents new challenges for MTS forecasting models: models should decouple complex inter-variable dependencies while addressing non-stationary distribution shift brought by environmental changes. To address these challenges and improve collaborative sensing reliability, we propose a Patch-Based Dual-Branch Channel-Temporal Forecasting Network (D-CTNet). Particularly, with a parallel dual-branch design incorporating linear temporal modeling layer and channel attention mechanism, our method explicitly decouples and jointly learns intra-channel temporal evolution patterns and dynamic multivariate correlations. Furthermore, a global patch attention fusion module goes beyond the local window scope to model long range dependencies. Most importantly, aiming at non-stationarity, a Frequency-Domain Stationarity Correction mechanism adaptively suppresses distribution shift impacts from environment change by spectrum alignment. Evaluations on seven benchmark datasets show that our model achieves better forecasting accuracy and robustness compared with state-of-the-art methods. Our work shows great promise as a new forecasting engine for industrial collaborative systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[ProtoTS: Learning Hierarchical Prototypes for Explainable Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23159v3)** | 2025-11-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While deep learning has achieved impressive performance in time series forecasting, it becomes increasingly crucial to understand its decision-making process for building trust in high-stakes scenarios. Existing interpretable models often provide only local and partial explanations, lacking the capability to reveal how heterogeneous and interacting input variables jointly shape the overall temporal patterns in the forecast curve. We propose ProtoTS, a novel interpretable forecasting framework that achieves both high accuracy and transparent decision-making through modeling prototypical temporal patterns. ProtoTS computes instance-prototype similarity based on a denoised representation that preserves abundant heterogeneous information. The prototypes are organized hierarchically to capture global temporal patterns with coarse prototypes while capturing finer-grained local variations with detailed prototypes, enabling expert steering and multi-level interpretability. Experiments on multiple realistic benchmarks, including a newly released LOF dataset, show that ProtoTS not only exceeds existing methods in forecast accuracy but also delivers expert-steerable interpretations for better model understanding and decision support.</p></details> | Under submission |
| **[Evaluating Spatio-Temporal Forecasting Trade-offs Between Graph Neural Networks and Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05179v2)** | 2025-11-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern IoT deployments for environmental sensing produce high volume spatiotemporal data to support downstream tasks such as forecasting, typically powered by machine learning models. While existing filtering and strategic deployment techniques optimize collected data volume at the edge, they overlook how variations in sampling frequencies and spatial coverage affect downstream model performance. In many forecasting models, incorporating data from additional sensors denoise predictions by providing broader spatial contexts. This interplay between sampling frequency, spatial coverage and different forecasting model architectures remain underexplored. This work presents a systematic study of forecasting models - classical models (VAR), neural networks (GRU, Transformer), spatio-temporal graph neural networks (STGNNs), and time series foundation models (TSFMs: Chronos Moirai, TimesFM) under varying spatial sensor nodes density and sampling intervals using real-world temperature data in a wireless sensor network. Our results show that STGNNs are effective when sensor deployments are sparse and sampling rate is moderate, leveraging spatial correlations via encoded graph structure to compensate for limited coverage. In contrast, TSFMs perform competitively at high frequencies but degrade when spatial coverage from neighboring sensors is reduced. Crucially, the multivariate TSFM Moirai outperforms all models by natively learning cross-sensor dependencies. These findings offer actionable insights for building efficient forecasting pipelines in spatio-temporal systems.

| **[Maximum Likelihood Estimation of the Vector AutoRegressive To Anything (VARTA) model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00631v1)** | 2025-11-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The literature on multivariate time series is, largely, limited to either models based on the multivariate Gaussian distribution or models specifically developed for a given application. In this paper we develop a general approach which is based on an underlying, unobserved, Gaussian Vector Autoregressive (VAR) model. Using a transformation, we can capture the time dynamics as well as the distributional properties of a multivariate time series. The model is called the Vector AutoRegressive To Anyting (VARTA) model and was originally presented by Biller and Nelson (2003) who used it for the purpose of simulation. In this paper we derive a maximum likelihood estimator for the model and investigate its performance. We also provide diagnostic analysis and how to compute the predictive distribution. The proposed approach can provide better estimates about the forecasting distributions which can be of every kind not necessarily Gaussian distributions as for the standard VAR models.</p></details> | 23 pages, 4 figures |
| **[High-dimensional Autoregressive Modeling for Time Series with Hierarchical Structures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00508v1)** | 2025-11-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-dimensional time series often exhibit hierarchical structures represented by tensors, while statistical methodologies that can effectively exploit the structural information remain limited. We propose a supervised factor modeling framework that accommodates general hierarchical structures by extracting low-dimensional features sequentially in the mode orders that respect the hierarchical structure. Our method can select a small collection of such orders to allow for impurities in the hierarchical structures, yielding interpretable loading matrices that preserve the hierarchical relationships. A practical estimation procedure is proposed, with a hyperparameter selection scheme that identifies a parsimonious set of action orders and interim ranks, thereby revealing the possibly latent hierarchical structures. Theoretically, non-asymptotic error bounds are derived for the proposed estimators in both regression and autoregressive settings. An application to the IPIP-NEO-120 personality panel illustrates superior forecasting performance and clearer structural interpretation compared with existing methods based on tensor decompositions and hierarchical factor analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Time Series Forecasting through Selective Representation Spaces: A Patch Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14510v4)** | 2025-11-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time Series Forecasting has made significant progress with the help of Patching technique, which partitions time series into multiple patches to effectively retain contextual semantic information into a representation space beneficial for modeling long-term dependencies. However, conventional patching partitions a time series into adjacent patches, which causes a fixed representation space, thus resulting in insufficiently expressful representations. In this paper, we pioneer the exploration of constructing a selective representation space to flexibly include the most informative patches for forecasting. Specifically, we propose the Selective Representation Space (SRS) module, which utilizes the learnable Selective Patching and Dynamic Reassembly techniques to adaptively select and shuffle the patches from the contextual time series, aiming at fully exploiting the information of contextual time series to enhance the forecasting performance of patch-based models. To demonstrate the effectiveness of SRS module, we propose a simple yet effective SRSNet consisting of SRS and an MLP head, which achieves state-of-the-art performance on real-world datasets from multiple domains. Furthermore, as a novel plug-and-play module, SRS can also enhance the performance of existing patch-based models.

The proposal of a holistic framework to establish a foundation for IoT systems with a focus on contextual decision making, proactive adaptation, and scalable structure. A structured process for IoT systems with accuracy and interconnected development would support reducing power consumption and support grid stability. This study presents the feasibility of this proposal through the application of each aspect of the framework. This system would have long term forecasting, short term forecasting, anomaly detection, and consideration of qualitative data with any energy management decisions taken. Performance was evaluated on Power Consumption Time Series data to display the direct application of the framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in IEEE Smart World Congress 2025, Calgary, Canada</p></details> |
| **[FiCoTS: Fine-to-Coarse LLM-Enhanced Hierarchical Cross-Modality Interaction for Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00293v1)** | 2025-11-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting is central to data analysis and web technologies. The recent success of Large Language Models (LLMs) offers significant potential for this field, especially from the cross-modality aspect. Most methods adopt an LLM-as-Predictor paradigm, using LLM as the forecasting backbone and designing modality alignment mechanisms to enable LLM to understand time series data. However, the semantic information in the two modalities of time series and text differs significantly, making it challenging for LLM to fully understand time series data. To mitigate this challenge, our work follows an LLM-as-Enhancer paradigm to fully utilize the advantage of LLM in text understanding, where LLM is only used to encode text modality to complement time series modality. Based on this paradigm, we propose FiCoTS, an LLM-enhanced fine-to-coarse framework for multimodal time series forecasting. Specifically, the framework facilitates progressive cross-modality interaction by three levels in a fine-to-coarse scheme: First, in the token-level modality alignment module, a dynamic heterogeneous graph is constructed to filter noise and align time series patches with text tokens; Second, in the feature-level modality interaction module, a global cross-attention mechanism is introduced to enable each time series variable to connect with relevant textual contexts; Third, in the decision-level modality fusion module, we design a gated network to adaptively fuse the results of the two modalities for robust predictions. These three modules work synergistically to let the two modalities interact comprehensively across three semantic levels, enabling textual information to effectively support temporal prediction. Extensive experiments on seven real-world benchmarks demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance. The codes will be released publicly.</p></details> |  |

As such, in this work, we propose a novel benchmarking approach: in particular, we aim at building a curated dataset reflecting real world physical temporal dynamics, extracting temporal signals from real-world videos using optical flow. As such, we introduce REAL-V-TSFM, a novel dataset designed to capture rich and diverse time series derived from real-world videos. Experimental results on state-of-the-art TSFMs under zero-shot forecasting show that, despite strong performance on conventional benchmarks, these models exhibit performance degradation on the proposed dataset, suggesting limited generalizability to novel datasets. These findings underscore the need for novel approaches to acquiring time series data and highlight the lack of universality in recent TSFMs, while further validating the effectiveness of our video-based time series data extraction pipeline.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by Artificial Intelligence for Time Series Analysis (AI4TS) Workshop @ AAAI 2026: Theory, Algorithms, and Applications</p></details> |
| **[Hierarchical AI-Meteorologist: LLM-Agent System for Multi-Scale and Explainable Weather Forecast Reporting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23387v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present the Hierarchical AI-Meteorologist, an LLM-agent system that generates explainable weather reports using a hierarchical forecast reasoning and weather keyword generation. Unlike standard approaches that treat forecasts as flat time series, our framework performs multi-scale reasoning across hourly, 6-hour, and daily aggregations to capture both short-term dynamics and long-term trends. Its core reasoning agent converts structured meteorological inputs into coherent narratives while simultaneously extracting a few keywords effectively summarizing the dominant meteorological events. These keywords serve as semantic anchors for validating consistency, temporal coherence and factual alignment of the generated reports. Using OpenWeather and Meteostat data, we demonstrate that hierarchical context and keyword-based validation substantially improve interpretability and robustness of LLM-generated weather narratives, offering a reproducible framework for semantic evaluation of automated meteorological reporting and advancing agent-based scientific reasoning.</p></details> | 9 pages, 4 figures |

We extend our focus and propose to mechanistically forward engineer using our framework based on Concept Bottleneck Models. In the context of long-term time series forecasting, we modify the training objective to encourage a model to develop representations which are similar to predefined, interpretable concepts using Centered Kernel Alignment. This steers the bottleneck components to learn the predefined concepts, while allowing other components to learn other, undefined concepts. We apply the framework to the Vanilla Transformer, Autoformer and FEDformer, and present an in-depth analysis on synthetic data and on a variety of benchmark datasets. We find that the model performance remains mostly unaffected, while the model shows much improved interpretability. Additionally, we verify the interpretation of the bottleneck components with an intervention experiment using activation patching.</p></details> |  |
| **[Time Series Forecasting via Direct Per-Step Probability Distribution Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23260v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep neural network-based time series prediction models have recently demonstrated superior capabilities in capturing complex temporal dependencies. However, it is challenging for these models to account for uncertainty associated with their predictions, because they directly output scalar values at each time step. To address such a challenge, we propose a novel model named interleaved dual-branch Probability Distribution Network (interPDN), which directly constructs discrete probability distributions per step instead of a scalar. The regression output at each time step is derived by computing the expectation of the predictive distribution on a predefined support set. To mitigate prediction anomalies, a dual-branch architecture is introduced with interleaved support sets, augmented by coarse temporal-scale branches for long-term trend forecasting. Outputs from another branch are treated as auxiliary signals to impose self-supervised consistency constraints on the current branch's prediction. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of interPDN.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 8 figures.

| **[Counterfactual Explanation for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting with Exogenous Variables](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06906v2)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Currently, machine learning is widely used across various domains, including time series data analysis. However, some machine learning models function as black boxes, making interpretability a critical concern. One approach to address this issue is counterfactual explanation (CE), which aims to provide insights into model predictions. This study focuses on the relatively underexplored problem of generating counterfactual explanations for time series forecasting. We propose a method for extracting CEs in time series forecasting using exogenous variables, which are frequently encountered in fields such as business and marketing. In addition, we present methods for analyzing the influence of each variable over an entire time series, generating CEs by altering only specific variables, and evaluating the quality of the resulting CEs. We validate the proposed method through theoretical analysis and empirical experiments, showcasing its accuracy and practical applicability. These contributions are expected to support real-world decision-making based on time series data analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>27pag...</summary><p>27pages,9figures,9tables</p></details> |
| **[TARFVAE: Efficient One-Step Generative Time Series Forecasting via TARFLOW based VAE](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22853v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series data is ubiquitous, with forecasting applications spanning from finance to healthcare. Beyond popular deterministic methods, generative models are gaining attention due to advancements in areas like image synthesis and video generation, as well as their inherent ability to provide probabilistic predictions. However, existing generative approaches mostly involve recurrent generative operations or repeated denoising steps, making the prediction laborious, particularly for long-term forecasting. Most of them only conduct experiments for relatively short-term forecasting, with limited comparison to deterministic methods in long-term forecasting, leaving their practical advantages unclear. This paper presents TARFVAE, a novel generative framework that combines the Transformer-based autoregressive flow (TARFLOW) and variational autoencoder (VAE) for efficient one-step generative time series forecasting. Inspired by the rethinking that complex architectures for extracting time series representations might not be necessary, we add a flow module, TARFLOW, to VAE to promote spontaneous learning of latent variables that benefit predictions. TARFLOW enhances VAE's posterior estimation by breaking the Gaussian assumption, thereby enabling a more informative latent space. TARFVAE uses only the forward process of TARFLOW, avoiding autoregressive inverse operations and thus ensuring fast generation. During generation, it samples from the prior latent space and directly generates full-horizon forecasts via the VAE decoder. With simple MLP modules, TARFVAE achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art deterministic and generative models across different forecast horizons on benchmark datasets while maintaining efficient prediction speed, demonstrating its effectiveness as an efficient and powerful solution for generative time series forecasting.</p></details> |  |

These large-scale models, trained on vast collections of time series, learn generalizable representations for both point and probabilistic forecasting, reducing the need for task-specific architectures and manual tuning. In this work, we review the main architectures, pretraining strategies, and optimization methods used in such models, and study the effect of fine-tuning after pretraining to enhance their performance on specific datasets. Our empirical results show that fine-tuning generally improves zero-shot forecasting capabilities, especially for long-term horizons.</p></details> | in French language |

| **[TS2Vec-Ensemble: An Enhanced Self-Supervised Framework for Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22395v1)** | 2025-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-supervised representation learning, particularly through contrastive methods like TS2Vec, has advanced the analysis of time series data. However, these models often falter in forecasting tasks because their objective functions prioritize instance discrimination over capturing the deterministic patterns, such as seasonality and trend, that are critical for accurate prediction. This paper introduces TS2Vec-Ensemble, a novel hybrid framework designed to bridge this gap. Our approach enhances the powerful, implicitly learned dynamics from a pretrained TS2Vec encoder by fusing them with explicit, engineered time features that encode periodic cycles. This fusion is achieved through a dual-model ensemble architecture, where two distinct regression heads -- one focused on learned dynamics and the other on seasonal patterns -- are combined using an adaptive weighting scheme. The ensemble weights are optimized independently for each forecast horizon, allowing the model to dynamically prioritize short-term dynamics or long-term seasonality as needed. We conduct extensive experiments on the ETT benchmark datasets for both univariate and multivariate forecasting. The results demonstrate that TS2Vec-Ensemble consistently and significantly outperforms the standard TS2Vec baseline and other state-of-the-art models, validating our hypothesis that a hybrid of learned representations and explicit temporal priors is a superior strategy for long-horizon time series forecasting.</p></details> |  |
| **[RI-Loss: A Learnable Residual-Informed Loss for Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10130v2)** | 2025-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting relies on predicting future values from historical data, yet most state-of-the-art approaches-including transformer and multilayer perceptron-based models-optimize using Mean Squared Error (MSE), which has two fundamental weaknesses: its point-wise error computation fails to capture temporal relationships, and it does not account for inherent noise in the data. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the Residual-Informed Loss (RI-Loss), a novel objective function based on the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC). RI-Loss explicitly models noise structure by enforcing dependence between the residual sequence and a random time series, enabling more robust, noise-aware representations. Theoretically, we derive the first non-asymptotic HSIC bound with explicit double-sample complexity terms, achieving optimal convergence rates through Bernstein-type concentration inequalities and Rademacher complexity analysis. This provides rigorous guarantees for RI-Loss optimization while precisely quantifying kernel space interactions.

| **[Beyond MSE: Ordinal Cross-Entropy for Probabilistic Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10200v2)** | 2025-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting is an important task that involves analyzing temporal dependencies and underlying patterns (such as trends, cyclicality, and seasonality) in historical data to predict future values or trends. Current deep learning-based forecasting models primarily employ Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss functions for regression modeling. Despite enabling direct value prediction, this method offers no uncertainty estimation and exhibits poor outlier robustness. To address these limitations, we propose OCE-TS, a novel ordinal classification approach for time series forecasting that replaces MSE with Ordinal Cross-Entropy (OCE) loss, preserving prediction order while quantifying uncertainty through probability output. Specifically, OCE-TS begins by discretizing observed values into ordered intervals and deriving their probabilities via a parametric distribution as supervision signals. Using a simple linear model, we then predict probability distributions for each timestep. The OCE loss is computed between the cumulative distributions of predicted and ground-truth probabilities, explicitly preserving ordinal relationships among forecasted values. Through theoretical analysis using influence functions, we establish that cross-entropy (CE) loss exhibits superior stability and outlier robustness compared to MSE loss. Empirically, we compared OCE-TS with five baseline models-Autoformer, DLinear, iTransformer, TimeXer, and TimeBridge-on seven public time series datasets. Using MSE and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) as evaluation metrics, the results demonstrate that OCE-TS consistently outperforms benchmark models. The codeis publicly available at: https://github.com/Shi-hm/OCE-TS.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Non-Stationary Time Series Forecasting with Temporal Stabilization and Frequency Differencing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08229v6)** | 2025-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting is critical for decision-making across dynamic domains such as energy, finance, transportation, and cloud computing. However, real-world time series often exhibit non-stationarity, including temporal distribution shifts and spectral variability, which pose significant challenges for long-term time series forecasting. In this paper, we propose DTAF, a dual-branch framework that addresses non-stationarity in both the temporal and frequency domains. For the temporal domain, the Temporal Stabilizing Fusion (TFS) module employs a non-stationary mix of experts (MOE) filter to disentangle and suppress temporal non-stationary patterns while preserving long-term dependencies. For the frequency domain, the Frequency Wave Modeling (FWM) module applies frequency differencing to dynamically highlight components with significant spectral shifts. By fusing the complementary outputs of TFS and FWM, DTAF generates robust forecasts that adapt to both temporal and frequency domain non-stationarity. Extensive experiments on real-world benchmarks demonstrate that DTAF outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, yielding significant improvements in forecasting accuracy under non-stationary conditions.

Dengue forecasting often relies on site-specific covariates and entomological data, limiting generalizability in data-sparse settings. We propose a data-parsimonious (DP) framework based on the incidence versus cumulative cases (ICC) curve, extending it from a basic SIR to a two-population SEIR model for dengue. Our DP model uses only the target season's incidence time series and estimates only two parameters, reducing noise and computational burden. A Bayesian extension quantifies the case reporting and fitting uncertainty to produce calibrated predictive intervals. We evaluated the performance of the DP model in the 2022-2023 outbreaks in Florida, where standardized clinical tests and reporting support accurate case determination. The DP framework demonstrates competitive predictive performance at substantially lower computational cost than more elaborate models, making it suitable for dengue early detection where dense surveillance or long historical records are unavailable.</p></details> |  |

While many state-of-the-art time series foundation models have been introduced, few studies examine their effectiveness in specific downstream applications in physical science. This work investigates the role of integrating domain knowledge into time series models for hydrological rainfall-runoff modeling. Using the CAMELS-US dataset, which includes rainfall and runoff data from 671 locations with six time series streams and 30 static features, we compare baseline and foundation models. Results demonstrate that models incorporating comprehensive known exogenous inputs outperform more limited approaches, including foundation models. Notably, incorporating natural annual periodic time series contribute the most significant improvements.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multivariate Spatio-temporal Modelling for Completing Cancer Registries and Forecasting Incidence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21714v2)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cancer data, particularly cancer incidence and mortality, are fundamental to understand the cancer burden, to set targets for cancer control and to evaluate the evolution of the implementation of a cancer control policy. However, the complexity of data collection, classification, validation and processing result in cancer incidence figures often lagging two to three years behind the calendar year. In response, national or regional population-based cancer registries (PBCRs) are increasingly interested in methods for forecasting cancer incidence. However, in many countries there is an additional difficulty in projecting cancer incidence as regional registries are usually not established in the same year and therefore cancer incidence data series between different regions of a country are not harmonised over time. This study addresses the challenge of forecasting cancer incidence with incomplete data at both regional and national levels. To achieve this, we propose the use of multivariate spatio-temporal shared component models that jointly model mortality data and available cancer incidence data. We evaluate the performance of these multivariate models using lung cancer incidence data and the corresponding number of deaths reported in England for the period 2001-2019. Model performance was assessed using different predictive measures to select the best model.</p></details> | 37 pages |

However, existing LLM-based approaches face notable limitations-such as marginalized role in model architectures, reliance on coarse statistical text prompts, and lack of interpretability. In this work, we introduce Augur, a fully LLM driven time series forecasting framework that exploits LLM causal reasoning to discover and use directed causal associations among covariates. Augur uses a two stage teacher student architecture where a powerful teacher LLM infers a directed causal graph from time series using heuristic search together with pairwise causality testing. A lightweight student agent then refines the graph and fine tune on high confidence causal associations that are encoded as rich textual prompts to perform forecasting. This design improves predictive accuracy while yielding transparent, traceable reasoning about variable interactions. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets with 26 baselines demonstrate that Augur achieves competitive performance and robust zero-shot generalization.</p></details> | 24 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Empowering Time Series Forecasting with LLM-Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04231v2)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM) powered agents have emerged as effective planners for Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) systems. While most existing AutoML approaches focus on automating feature engineering and model architecture search, recent studies in time series forecasting suggest that lightweight models can often achieve state-of-the-art performance. This observation led us to explore improving data quality, rather than model architecture, as a potentially fruitful direction for AutoML on time series data. We propose DCATS, a Data-Centric Agent for Time Series. DCATS leverages metadata accompanying time series to clean data while optimizing forecasting performance. We evaluated DCATS using four time series forecasting models on a large-scale traffic volume forecasting dataset. Results demonstrate that DCATS achieves an average 6% error reduction across all tested models and time horizons, highlighting the potential of data-centric approaches in AutoML for time series forecasting.</p></details> |  |
| **[TiCT: A Synthetically Pre-Trained Foundation Model for Time Series Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19694v2)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ubiquity of time series data creates a strong demand for general-purpose foundation models, yet developing them for classification remains a significant challenge, largely due to the high cost of labeled data. Foundation models capable of in-context learning (ICL) offer a powerful solution, adapting to new tasks with minimal examples and reducing the need for extensive retraining. However, prior work on large-scale time series models has predominantly focused on forecasting, leaving a critical gap for versatile, fine-tuning-free classification. To address this, we introduce TiCT (Time-series in-Context Transformer), a transformer-based model pre-trained exclusively on synthetic data to perform in-context classification. We make two primary technical contributions: 1) a novel architecture featuring a scalable bit-based label encoding and a special output attention mechanism to handle an arbitrary number of classes; and 2) a synthetic pre-training framework that combines a Mixup-inspired process with data augmentation to foster generalization and noise invariance. Extensive evaluations on the UCR Archive show that TiCT achieves competitive performance against state-of-the-art supervised methods. Crucially, this is accomplished using only in-context examples at inference time, without updating a single model weight.</p></details> |  |
| **[TS-RAG: Retrieval-Augmented Generation based Time Series Foundation Models are Stronger Zero-Shot Forecaster](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07649v4)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) and Foundation Models (FMs) have recently become prevalent for time series forecasting tasks. While fine-tuning LLMs enables domain adaptation, they often struggle to generalize across diverse and unseen datasets. Moreover, existing Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) still face challenges in handling non-stationary dynamics and distribution shifts, largely due to the lack of effective mechanisms for adaptation. To this end, we present TS-RAG, a retrieval-augmented generation framework for time series forecasting that enhances the generalization and interpretability of TSFMs. Specifically, TS-RAG leverages pre-trained time series encoders to retrieve semantically relevant segments from a dedicated knowledge base, enriching the contextual representation of the input query. Furthermore, we propose an Adaptive Retrieval Mixer (ARM) module that dynamically fuses the retrieved patterns with the TSFM's internal representation, improving forecasting accuracy without requiring task-specific fine-tuning. Thorough empirical studies on seven public benchmark datasets demonstrate that TS-RAG achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot forecasting performance, outperforming the existing TSFMs by up to 6.84% across diverse domains while also providing desirable interpretability.

| **[MSTN: Fast and Efficient Multivariate Time Series Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20577v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world time-series data is highly non stationary and complex in dynamics that operate across multiple timescales, ranging from fast, short-term changes to slow, long-term trends. Most existing models rely on fixed-scale structural priors, such as patch-based tokenization, fixed frequency transformations, or frozen backbone architectures. This often leads to over-regularization of temporal dynamics, which limits their ability to adaptively model the full spectrum of temporal variations and impairs their performance on unpredictable, Sudden, high-magnitude events. To address this, we introduce the Multi-scale Temporal Network (MSTN), a novel deep learning architecture founded on a hierarchical multi-scale and sequence modeling principle. The MSTN framework integrates: (i) a multi-scale convolutional encoder that constructs a hierarchical feature pyramid for local patterns (ii) a sequence modeling component for long-range temporal dependencies. We empirically validate this with BiLSTM and Transformer variants, establishing a flexible foundation for future architectural advancements. and (iii) a gated fusion mechanism augmented with squeeze-and-excitation (SE) and multi-head temporal attention (MHTA) for dynamic, context-aware feature integration. This design enables MSTN to adaptively model temporal patterns from milliseconds to long-range dependencies within a unified framework. Extensive evaluations across time-series long-horizon forecasting, imputation, classification and generalizability study demonstrate that MSTN achieves competitive state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, showing improvements over contemporary approaches including EMTSF, LLM4TS, HiMTM, TIME-LLM, MTST, SOFTS, iTransformer, TimesNet, and PatchTST. In total, MSTN establishes new SOTA performance on 24 of 32 benchmark datasets, demonstrating its consistent performance across diverse temporal tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 1 figure, 5 tables</p></details> |

We present methods for estimating the locations and number of breaks using a dynamic programming algorithm and a sequential prediction-interval-based procedure, respectively, and outline strategies for specifying and estimating the full model. Empirical analysis of U.S. exports of goods to Mainland China (2006-2025) demonstrates that the STSA model accurately identifies structural breaks linked to major economic events and provides a meaningful decomposition of the underlying economic cycle dynamics. Evaluation on the monthly M4 Competition data shows that STSA significantly outperforms Prophet and, while generally less accurate than stochastic trend models such as ARIMA, ETS, TBATS, and Theta, it produces superior forecasts for series with abrupt structural breaks where stochastic approaches struggle to adapt. Unlike traditional time series models, STSA offers an interpretable decomposition that reveals the causal narrative behind the series' evolution, enhancing the credibility of out-of-sample forecasts.</p></details> |  |
| **[RED-F: Reconstruction-Elimination based Dual-stream Contrastive Forecasting for Multivariate Time Series Anomaly Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20044v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The proactive prediction of anomalies (AP) in multivariate time series (MTS) is a critical challenge to ensure system dependability. The difficulty lies in identifying subtle anomaly precursors concealed within normal signals. However, existing unsupervised methods, trained exclusively on normal data, demonstrate a fundamental propensity to reconstruct normal patterns. Consequently, when confronted with weak precursors, their predictions are dominated by the normal pattern, submerging the very signal required for prediction. To contend with the limitation, we propose RED-F, a Reconstruction-Elimination based Dual-stream Contrastive Forecasting framework, comprising the Reconstruction-Elimination Model (REM) and the Dual-stream Contrastive Forecasting Model (DFM). The REM utilizes a hybrid time-frequency mechanism to mitigate the precursor, generating a purified, normal-pattern baseline. The DFM then receives this purified baseline and the original sequence which retains the precursor as parallel inputs. At the core of our framework, RED-F employs a contrastive forecast that transforms the difficult task of absolute signal detection into a simpler, more robust task of relative trajectory comparison by computing the divergence between these two predictive streams. This contrastive mechanism serves to amplify the faint precursor signal. Furthermore, the DFM is trained with a novel Multi-Series Prediction (MSP) objective, which leverages distant future context to enhance its predictive sensitivity. Extensive experiments on six real-world datasets demonstrate the superior capability of RED-F in anomaly prediction tasks.</p></details> | 13 pages, 12 figures |

Using the HiQ dataset (U.S., 2000-2022), we systematically compare statistical baselines, a fully supervised LSTM, and the Sundial foundation model under multiple evaluation protocols. We find that Sundial, in the zero-shot setting, can outperform a fully trained LSTM provided that the input context window is sufficiently long-specifically, when covering more than one or two full seasonal cycles. This demonstrates, for the first time, that a general-purpose foundation model can surpass specialized supervised models on remote-sensing time series prediction without any task-specific tuning. These results highlight the strong potential of pretrained time-series foundation models to serve as effective plug-and-play forecasters in agricultural and environmental applications.</p></details> |  |

However, facing the challenge of cross-domain generalization, existing studies utilize statistical prior as prompt engineering fails under the huge distribution shift among various domains. In this paper, a novel time series generalization diffusion model (TimeControl) that pioneers the Domain-Fusion paradigm, systematically integrating information from multiple time series domains into a unified generative process via diffusion models. Unlike the autoregressive models that capture the conditional probabilities of the prediction horizon to the historical sequence, we use the diffusion denoising process to model the mixed distribution of the cross-domain data and generate the prediction sequence for the target domain directly utilizing conditional sampling. The proposed TimeControl contains three pivotal designs: (1) The condition network captures the multi-scale fluctuation patterns from the observation sequence, which are utilized as context representations to guide the denoising network to generate the prediction sequence; (2) Adapter-based fine-tuning strategy, the multi-domain universal representation learned in the pretraining stage is utilized for downstream tasks in target domains; (3) A novel hybrid architecture is designed to align the observation and prediction spaces, enabling TimeControl to generate prediction sequences of arbitrary lengths with flexibility. We conduct extensive experiments on mainstream 49 benchmarks and 30 baselines, and the TimeControl outperforms existing baselines on all data domains, exhibiting superior zero-shot generalization ability.</p></details> | <details><summary>We ha...</summary><p>We have updated the abstract, introduction and related work.

While deep learning approaches have achieved significant success in this field, existing methods often adopt a "one-model one-task" architecture, limiting their generalization across different tasks. To address these limitations, we perform local energy analysis in the time-frequency domain to more precisely capture and disentangle transient and non-stationary oscillatory components. Furthermore, our representational analysis reveals that generative tasks tend to capture long-period patterns from low-frequency components, whereas discriminative tasks focus on high-frequency abrupt signals, which constitutes our core contribution. Concretely, we propose Pets, a novel "one-model many-tasks" architecture based on the General fluctuation Pattern Assisted (GPA) framework that is adaptable to versatile model structures for time series analysis. Pets integrates a Fluctuation Pattern Assisted (FPA) module and a Context-Guided Mixture of Predictors (MoP). The FPA module facilitates information fusion among diverse fluctuation patterns by capturing their dependencies and progressively modeling these patterns as latent representations at each layer. Meanwhile, the MoP module leverages these generalizable pattern representations to guide and regulate the reconstruction of distinct fluctuations hierarchically by energy proportion. Pets demonstrates strong versatility and achieves state-of-the-art performance across 60 benchmarks on various tasks, including forecasting, imputation, anomaly detection, and classification, while demonstrating strong generalization and robustness.</p></details> | <details><summary>We ha...</summary><p>We have updated the abstract, citations and related work.

However, the potential of using non-visual, continuous sequential, as a conditioning signal for high-fidelity image generation remains largely unexplored. Furthermore, existing methods that convert series into "pseudo-images" for temporal forecasting fail to establish semantic-level alignment. In this paper, we propose TimeArtist, a temporal-visual conversion framework that pioneers semantic-level alignment between time series fluctuations and visual concepts. It pioneers a "warmup-align" paradigm: first, a dual-autoencoder and shared quantizer are self-supervised trained on large-scale datasets to learn modality-shared representations. Then, the encoders and quantizer are frozen, and a projection is introduced to align temporal and visual samples at the representation level. TimeArtist establishes a versatile cross-modal framework, enabling high-quality, diverse image generation directly from time series, while capturing temporal fluctuation patterns to render images as styles transfer. Extensive experiments show that TimeArtist achieves satisfactory performance in image generation metrics, while also attaining superior results in zero-shot temporal tasks. Our work establishes a new paradigm for cross-modal generation, bridging the gap between temporal dynamics and visual semantics.</p></details> |  |

This time series foundation model is the result of a general architectural innovation to a time series model enabling it to accept multiresolution input, applied to a popular decoder-only time series model (TimesFM). The resulting multiresolution decoder-only model is trained on over 300B unique data points, with more than half coming from the observability domain. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate that the resulting model achieves superior performance on observability datasets while retaining very similar performance on a standard general-purpose forecasting benchmark (GIFT-Eval), and suggest that the multiresolution structure enables the model to make more accurate predictions on long context input.</p></details> |  |

Grids have managed the resulting surges by scaling generation capacity, incorporating additional resources such as solar and wind, and implementing demand-response mechanisms. Altogether, these policies influence a region's carbon intensity by affecting its energy mix. To mitigate the environmental impacts of consumption, carbon-aware optimizations often rely on long-horizon, high-accuracy forecasts of the grid's carbon intensity that typically use compute intensive models with extensive historical energy mix data. In addition to limiting scalability, accuracy improvements do not necessarily translate into proportional increases in savings. Highlighting the need for more efficient forecasting strategies, we argue that carbon forecasting solutions can achieve the majority of savings without requiring highly precise and complex predictions. Instead, it is the preservation of the ranking of forecasts relative to the ground-truth that drives realized savings. In this paper, we present LiteCast, a lightweight time series forecasting method capable of quickly modeling a region's energy mix to estimate its carbon intensity. LiteCast requires only a few days of historical energy and weather data, delivering fast forecasts that can quickly adapt to sudden changes in the electrical grid. Our evaluation in 50 worldwide regions under various real-world workloads shows that LiteCast outperforms state-of-the-art forecasters, delivering 20% higher savings with near-optimal performance, achieving 97% of the maximum attainable average savings, while remaining lightweight, efficient to run, and adaptive to new data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Structured Noise Modeling for Enhanced Time-Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19657v1)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time-series forecasting remains difficult in real-world settings because temporal patterns operate at multiple scales, from broad contextual trends to fast, fine-grained fluctuations that drive critical decisions. Existing neural models often struggle to represent these interacting dynamics, leading to unstable predictions and reduced reliability in downstream applications. This work introduces a forecast-blur-denoise framework that improves temporal fidelity through structured noise modeling. The approach incorporates a learnable Gaussian Process module that generates smooth, correlated perturbations, encouraging the forecasting backbone to capture long-range structure while a dedicated refinement model restores high-resolution temporal detail. Training the components jointly enables natural competence division and avoids the artifacts commonly produced by isotropic corruption methods. Experiments across electricity, traffic, and solar datasets show consistent gains in multi-horizon accuracy and stability. The modular design also allows the blur-denoise layer to operate as a lightweight enhancement for pretrained models, supporting efficient adaptation in limited-data scenarios. By strengthening the reliability and interpretability of fine-scale temporal predictions, this framework contributes to more trustworthy AI systems used in forecasting-driven decision support across energy, infrastructure, and other time-critical domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[Targeted Manipulation: Slope-Based Attacks on Financial Time-Series Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19330v1)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A common method of attacking deep learning models is through adversarial attacks, which occur when an attacker specifically modifies the input of a model to produce an incorrect result. Adversarial attacks have been deeply investigated in the image domain; however, there is less research in the time-series domain and very little for forecasting financial data. To address these concerns, this study aims to build upon previous research on adversarial attacks for time-series data by introducing two new slope-based methods aimed to alter the trends of the predicted stock forecast generated by an N-HiTS model. Compared to the normal N-HiTS predictions, the two new slope-based methods, the General Slope Attack and Least-Squares Slope Attack, can manipulate N-HiTS predictions by doubling the slope. These new slope attacks can bypass standard security mechanisms, such as a discriminator that filters real and perturbed inputs, reducing a 4-layered CNN's specificity to 28% and accuracy to 57%. Furthermore, the slope based methods were incorporated into a GAN architecture as a means of generating realistic synthetic data, while simultaneously fooling the model. Finally, this paper also proposes a sample malware designed to inject an adversarial attack in the model inference library, proving that ML-security research should not only focus on making the model safe, but also securing the entire pipeline.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 6 figures, 4 tables, preprint; Total including Appendix: 21 pages, 11 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |

It comprises 23M total parameters, trained on a single A100 GPU in less than a week using a new synthetic data generation and data augmentation pipeline (SynthTS). Without any neural architecture search, hyperparameter tuning, or scaling up model size, Tiny-TSM achieves state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of time series benchmark datasets, often outperforming much larger models and even matching the performance of much larger, industrial-scale, likely highly tuned foundation models. Specifically, Tiny-TSM outperforms all other time series foundation models we evaluated on medium- and long-term forecasting tasks under MSE loss, while short-term accuracy is still competitive with state-of-the-art models. We also introduce a causal input normalization scheme that enables time series models to be trained with dense next-token prediction loss, significantly accelerating convergence speed and reducing training time. All experiments were conducted on a single A100 GPU, illustrating the practicality of the proposed approach in a resource-constrained setting.</p></details> |  |
| **[SimDiff: Simpler Yet Better Diffusion Model for Time Series Point Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19256v1)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have recently shown promise in time series forecasting, particularly for probabilistic predictions. However, they often fail to achieve state-of-the-art point estimation performance compared to regression-based methods. This limitation stems from difficulties in providing sufficient contextual bias to track distribution shifts and in balancing output diversity with the stability and precision required for point forecasts. Existing diffusion-based approaches mainly focus on full-distribution modeling under probabilistic frameworks, often with likelihood maximization objectives, while paying little attention to dedicated strategies for high-accuracy point estimation. Moreover, other existing point prediction diffusion methods frequently rely on pre-trained or jointly trained mature models for contextual bias, sacrificing the generative flexibility of diffusion models. To address these challenges, we propose SimDiff, a single-stage, end-to-end framework. SimDiff employs a single unified Transformer network carefully tailored to serve as both denoiser and predictor, eliminating the need for external pre-trained or jointly trained regressors. It achieves state-of-the-art point estimation performance by leveraging intrinsic output diversity and improving mean squared error accuracy through multiple inference ensembling. Key innovations, including normalization independence and the median-of-means estimator, further enhance adaptability and stability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SimDiff significantly outperforms existing methods in time series point forecasting.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026</p></details> |

Synthetic data generation presents a promising solution by producing artificial datasets that maintain the statistical properties of real biomedical time-series data without compromising patient confidentiality. While GANs, VAEs, and diffusion models capture global data distributions, forecasting models offer inductive biases tailored for sequential dynamics. We propose a framework for synthetic biomedical time-series data generation based on recent forecasting models that accurately replicates complex electrophysiological signals such as EEG and EMG with high fidelity. These synthetic datasets can be freely shared for open AI development and consistently improve downstream model performance. Numerical results on sleep-stage classification show up to a 3.71\% performance gain with augmentation and a 91.00\% synthetic-only accuracy that surpasses the real-data-only baseline.</p></details> | 22 pages |
| **[WaveTuner: Comprehensive Wavelet Subband Tuning for Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18846v1)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to the inherent complexity, temporal patterns in real-world time series often evolve across multiple intertwined scales, including long-term periodicity, short-term fluctuations, and abrupt regime shifts. While existing literature has designed many sophisticated decomposition approaches based on the time or frequency domain to partition trend-seasonality components and high-low frequency components, an alternative line of approaches based on the wavelet domain has been proposed to provide a unified multi-resolution representation with precise time-frequency localization. However, most wavelet-based methods suffer from a persistent bias toward recursively decomposing only low-frequency components, severely underutilizing subtle yet informative high-frequency components that are pivotal for precise time series forecasting. To address this problem, we propose WaveTuner, a Wavelet decomposition framework empowered by full-spectrum subband Tuning for time series forecasting. Concretely, WaveTuner comprises two key modules: (i) Adaptive Wavelet Refinement module, that transforms time series into time-frequency coefficients, utilizes an adaptive router to dynamically assign subband weights, and generates subband-specific embeddings to support refinement; and (ii) Multi-Branch Specialization module, that employs multiple functional branches, each instantiated as a flexible Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) with a distinct functional order to model a specific spectral subband. Equipped with these modules, WaveTuner comprehensively tunes global trends and local variations within a unified time-frequency framework. Extensive experiments on eight real-world datasets demonstrate WaveTuner achieves state-of-the-art forecasting performance in time series forecasting.</p></details> |  |
| **[WaveletDiff: Multilevel Wavelet Diffusion For Time Series Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11839v2)** | 2025-11-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series are ubiquitous in many applications that involve forecasting, classification and causal inference tasks, such as healthcare, finance, audio signal processing and climate sciences. Still, large, high-quality time series datasets remain scarce. Synthetic generation can address this limitation; however, current models confined either to the time or frequency domains struggle to reproduce the inherently multi-scaled structure of real-world time series. We introduce WaveletDiff, a novel framework that trains diffusion models directly on wavelet coefficients to exploit the inherent multi-resolution structure of time series data. The model combines dedicated transformers for each decomposition level with cross-level attention mechanisms that enable selective information exchange between temporal and frequency scales through adaptive gating. It also incorporates energy preservation constraints for individual levels based on Parseval's theorem to preserve spectral fidelity throughout the diffusion process. Comprehensive tests across six real-world datasets from energy, finance, and neuroscience domains demonstrate that WaveletDiff consistently outperforms state-of-the-art time-domain and frequency-domain generative methods on both short and long time series across five diverse performance metrics. For example, WaveletDiff achieves discriminative scores and Context-FID scores that are $3\times$ smaller on average than the second-best baseline across all datasets.</p></details> |  |

Standard KAN, while offering theoretical interpretability through the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem, exhibits significantly higher error rates and limited practical applicability for time series forecasting. The results confirm LSTM dominance in accuracy-critical time series applications while identifying computational efficiency as KANs' primary advantage in resource-constrained scenarios where accuracy requirements are less stringent.

Recent advances in time series foundation models (TSFMs), inspired by large language models, offer a new paradigm for learning generalizable temporal representations from large and diverse datasets. This paper presents the first comprehensive empirical study of TSFMs in global financial markets. Using a large-scale dataset of daily excess returns across diverse markets, we evaluate zero-shot inference, fine-tuning, and pre-training from scratch against strong benchmark models. We find that off-the-shelf pre-trained TSFMs perform poorly in zero-shot and fine-tuning settings, whereas models pre-trained from scratch on financial data achieve substantial forecasting and economic improvements, underscoring the value of domain-specific adaptation. Increasing the dataset size, incorporating synthetic data augmentation, and applying hyperparameter tuning further enhance performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[TimePre: Bridging Accuracy, Efficiency, and Stability in Probabilistic Time-Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18539v1)** | 2025-11-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Probabilistic Time-Series Forecasting (PTSF) is critical for uncertainty-aware decision making, but existing generative models, such as diffusion-based approaches, are computationally prohibitive due to expensive iterative sampling. Non-sampling frameworks like Multiple Choice Learning (MCL) offer an efficient alternative, but suffer from severe training instability and hypothesis collapse, which has historically hindered their performance. This problem is dramatically exacerbated when attempting to combine them with modern, efficient MLP-based backbones. To resolve this fundamental incompatibility, we propose TimePre, a novel framework that successfully unifies the efficiency of MLP-based models with the distributional flexibility of the MCL paradigm. The core of our solution is Stabilized Instance Normalization (SIN), a novel normalization layer that explicitly remedies this incompatibility. SIN stabilizes the hybrid architecture by correcting channel-wise statistical shifts, definitively resolving the catastrophic hypothesis collapse. Extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets demonstrate that TimePre achieves new state-of-the-art accuracy on key probabilistic metrics. Critically, TimePre achieves inference speeds orders of magnitude faster than sampling-based models and, unlike prior MCL work, demonstrates stable performance scaling. It thus bridges the long-standing gap between accuracy, efficiency, and stability in probabilistic forecasting.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 5 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

Despite these advancements, its utilization in time series forecasting (TSF) has yet to meet expectations. Exploring a better network structure for attention in TSF holds immense significance across various domains. In this paper, we present PeriodNet with a brand new structure to forecast univariate and multivariate time series. PeriodNet incorporates period attention and sparse period attention mechanism for analyzing adjacent periods. It enhances the mining of local characteristics, periodic patterns, and global dependencies. For efficient cross-variable modeling, we introduce an iterative grouping mechanism which can directly reduce the cross-variable redundancy. To fully leverage the extracted features on the encoder side, we redesign the entire architecture of the vanilla Transformer and propose a period diffuser for precise multi-period prediction. Through comprehensive experiments conducted on eight datasets, we demonstrate that PeriodNet outperforms six state-of-the-art models in both univariate and multivariate TSF scenarios in terms of mean square error and mean absolute error. In particular, PeriodNet achieves a relative improvement of 22% when forecasting time series with a length of 720, in comparison to other models based on the conventional encoder-decoder Transformer architecture.</p></details> |  |

However, vital signs are often noisy and exhibit rapid fluctuations, while laboratory tests suffer from missing values, measurement lags, and device-specific bias, making integrative forecasting highly challenging. To address these issues, we propose OmniTFT, a deep learning framework that jointly learns and forecasts high-frequency vital signs and sparsely sampled laboratory results based on the Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT). Specifically, OmniTFT implements four novel strategies to enhance performance: sliding window equalized sampling to balance physiological states, frequency-aware embedding shrinkage to stabilize rare-class representations, hierarchical variable selection to guide model attention toward informative feature clusters, and influence-aligned attention calibration to enhance robustness during abrupt physiological changes. By reducing the reliance on target-specific architectures and extensive feature engineering, OmniTFT enables unified modeling of multiple heterogeneous clinical targets while preserving cross-institutional generalizability. Across forecasting tasks, OmniTFT achieves substantial performance improvement for both vital signs and laboratory results on the MIMIC-III, MIMIC-IV, and eICU datasets. Its attention patterns are interpretable and consistent with known pathophysiology, underscoring its potential utility for quantitative decision support in clinical care.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 5 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

While Transformer-based models have demonstrated strong performance in modeling the temporal dynamics of dense trajectories of humans and vehicles in smart cities, they usually lack access to broader contextual knowledge that enhances the forecasting reliability of sparse meteorological trajectories, such as typhoon tracks. To address this challenge, we propose TyphoFormer, a novel framework that incorporates natural language descriptions as auxiliary prompts to improve typhoon trajectory forecasting. For each time step, we use Large Language Model (LLM) to generate concise textual descriptions based on the numerical attributes recorded in the North Atlantic hurricane database. The language descriptions capture high-level meteorological semantics and are embedded as auxiliary special tokens prepended to the numerical time series input. By integrating both textual and sequential information within a unified Transformer encoder, TyphoFormer enables the model to leverage contextual cues that are otherwise inaccessible through numerical features alone. Extensive experiments are conducted on HURDAT2 benchmark, results show that TyphoFormer consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art baseline methods, particularly under challenging scenarios involving nonlinear path shifts and limited historical observations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM SIGSPATIAL 2025.

| **[Accelerating Time Series Foundation Models with Speculative Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18191v1)** | 2025-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern web applications--from real-time content recommendation and dynamic pricing to CDN optimization--increasingly rely on time-series forecasting to deliver personalized experiences to billions of users. Large-scale Transformer-based models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in time-series forecasting but suffer from high computational costs, limiting their deployment in latency-sensitive web applications. To address this challenge, we propose a general inference acceleration framework that adapts speculative decoding to autoregressive time-series models. Our approach employs a smaller "draft" model to propose future time-series patches, which are then verified in parallel by a larger "target" model, reducing the number of sequential forward passes required. We address key technical challenges in adapting this technique from discrete language tokens to continuous time-series distributions, including the design of acceptance criteria for multivariate Gaussian patches and practical variants that balance efficiency with accuracy. Through experiments on time series forecasting benchmarks relevant to web applications, we demonstrate significant inference speedups while maintaining competitive accuracy. The framework requires no architectural modifications to existing foundation models, making it immediately applicable to accelerate deployed time-series forecasting systems. Our implementation can be found at https://github.com/PranavSubbaraman/STRIDE</p></details> | 14 pages, 7 figures |

We propose a novel Supervised Deep Dynamic Principal component analysis (SDDP) framework that incorporates the target variable and lagged observations into the factor extraction process. Assisted by a temporal neural network, we construct target-aware predictors by scaling the original predictors in a supervised manner, with larger weights assigned to predictors with stronger forecasting power. A principal component analysis is then performed on the target-aware predictors to extract the estimated SDDP factors. This supervised factor extraction not only improves predictive accuracy in the downstream forecasting task but also yields more interpretable and target-specific latent factors. Building upon SDDP, we propose a factor-augmented nonlinear dynamic forecasting model that unifies a broad family of factor-model-based forecasting approaches. To further demonstrate the broader applicability of SDDP, we extend our studies to a more challenging scenario when the predictors are only partially observable. We validate the empirical performance of the proposed method on several real-world public datasets. The results show that our algorithm achieves notable improvements in forecasting accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

We introduce AutoHFormer, a hierarchical autoregressive transformer that addresses these challenges through three key innovations: 1) Hierarchical Temporal Modeling: Our architecture decomposes predictions into segment-level blocks processed in parallel, followed by intra-segment sequential refinement. This dual-scale approach maintains temporal coherence while enabling efficient computation. 2) Dynamic Windowed Attention: The attention mechanism employs learnable causal windows with exponential decay, reducing complexity while preserving precise temporal relationships. This design avoids both the anti-causal violations of standard transformers and the sequential bottlenecks of RNN hybrids. 3) Adaptive Temporal Encoding: a novel position encoding system is adopted to capture time patterns at multiple scales. It combines fixed oscillating patterns for short-term variations with learnable decay rates for long-term trends. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that AutoHFormer 10.76X faster training and 6.06X memory reduction compared to PatchTST on PEMS08, while maintaining consistent accuracy across 96-720 step horizons in most of cases. These breakthroughs establish new benchmarks for efficient and precise time series modeling.

The default strategy, sequential fine-tuning on each new phase, is architecture-agnostic but often suffers catastrophic forgetting when later phases correspond to different sub-populations or tasks. Replay with a finite buffer is a simple alternative, yet its behaviour across generative and predictive objectives is not well understood. We present a unified study of stateful replay for streaming autoencoding, time series forecasting, and classification. We view both sequential fine-tuning and replay as stochastic gradient methods for an ideal joint objective, and use a gradient alignment analysis to show when mixing current and historical samples should reduce forgetting. We then evaluate a single replay mechanism on six streaming scenarios built from Rotated MNIST, ElectricityLoadDiagrams 2011-2014, and Airlines delay data, using matched training budgets and three seeds. On heterogeneous multi task streams, replay reduces average forgetting by a factor of two to three, while on benign time based streams both methods perform similarly. These results position stateful replay as a strong and simple baseline for continual learning in streaming environments.</p></details> | 11 pages, 4 figures |

The model adopts quantile forecasting and multi-token prediction, improving both probabilistic accuracy and inference efficiency. On the Gift-Eval benchmark, it ranks among the top pretrained models while achieving a strong trade-off between accuracy, speed, and model size. Compared to Moirai 1.0, Moirai 2.0 replaces masked-encoder training, multi-patch inputs, and mixture-distribution outputs with a simpler decoder-only architecture, single patch, and quantile loss. Ablation studies isolate these changes -- showing that the decoder-only backbone along with recursive multi-quantile decoding contribute most to the gains. Additional experiments show that Moirai 2.0 outperforms larger models from the same family and exhibits robust domain-level results. In terms of efficiency and model size, Moirai 2.0 is twice as fast and thirty times smaller than its prior best version, Moirai 1.0-Large, while also performing better. Model performance plateaus with increasing parameter count and declines at longer horizons, motivating future work on data scaling and long-horizon modeling.

| **[Prequential posteriors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17721v1)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data assimilation is a fundamental task in updating forecasting models upon observing new data, with applications ranging from weather prediction to online reinforcement learning. Deep generative forecasting models (DGFMs) have shown excellent performance in these areas, but assimilating data into such models is challenging due to their intractable likelihood functions. This limitation restricts the use of standard Bayesian data assimilation methodologies for DGFMs. To overcome this, we introduce prequential posteriors, based upon a predictive-sequential (prequential) loss function; an approach naturally suited for temporally dependent data which is the focus of forecasting tasks. Since the true data-generating process often lies outside the assumed model class, we adopt an alternative notion of consistency and prove that, under mild conditions, both the prequential loss minimizer and the prequential posterior concentrate around parameters with optimal predictive performance. For scalable inference, we employ easily parallelizable wastefree sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) samplers with preconditioned gradient-based kernels, enabling efficient exploration of high-dimensional parameter spaces such as those in DGFMs. We validate our method on both a synthetic multi-dimensional time series and a real-world meteorological dataset; highlighting its practical utility for data assimilation for complex dynamical systems.</p></details> |  |

Each signal is windowed, amplitude-encoded, transformed by a QFT, then passed through a protective rotation layer to avoid the QFT/QFT adjoint cancellation; the resulting kernel is used in kernel ridge regression (KRR). Exogenous predictors are incorporated by convexly fusing feature-specific kernels. On multi-station solar irradiance data across Koppen climate classes, the proposed kernel consistently improves median R2 and nRMSE over reference classical RBF and polynomials kernels, while also reducing bias (nMBE); complementary MAE/ERMAX analyses indicate tighter average errors with remaining headroom under sharp transients. For both quantum and classical models, the only tuned quantities are the feature-mixing weights and the KRR ridge alpha; classical hyperparameters (gamma, r, d) are fixed, with the same validation set size for all models. Experiments are conducted on a noiseless simulator (5 qubits; window length L=32). Limitations and ablations are discussed, and paths toward NISQ execution are outlined.</p></details> | 33 pages, 13 figures |

While pretrained time series foundation models are gaining popularity, they face the following challenges: (1) Unlike natural language tasks, time series data vary in frequency, channel numbers, historical/prediction lengths. For long-term forecasting tasks in particular, tailored fine-tuning can significantly enhance performance.(2) Existing parameter-efficient tuning methods like LoRA remain applicable but require adaptation to temporal characteristics. To address these challenges, our TRACE framework introduces two key innovations: (1) Gated DSIC (Gated Dynamic Simulation Importance Calculation), an unbiased LoRA module importance selection mechanism that ensures conditional parameter consistency before and after masking. Experiments demonstrate that Gated DSIC outperforms common fine-tuning. (2) Reconstructed prediction heads for long-term forecasting tasks, which achieve comparable or superior performance to linear probing heads while drastically reducing parameter counts. Extensive experiments on long-/short-term forecasting, anomaly detection and natural language tasks across diverse datasets, coupled with ablation studies, validate the effectiveness of our method.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we define a concept of talent breakout and propose a method to detect Japanese talents before their rise to stardom. The main focus of the study is to determine the effectiveness of combining Twitter and TV data on predicting time-dependent changes in social data. Although traditional time-series models are known to be robust in many applications, the success of neural network models in various fields (e.g.\ Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision, Reinforcement Learning) continues to spark an interest in the time-series community to apply new techniques in practice. Therefore, in order to find the best modeling approach, we have experimented with traditional, neural network and ensemble learning methods. We observe that ensemble learning methods outperform traditional and neural network models based on standard regression metrics. However, by utilizing the concept of talent breakout, we are able to assess the true forecasting ability of the models, where neural networks outperform traditional and ensemble learning methods in terms of precision and recall.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 pages.

A key challenge, however, is that real-world measurements are often corrupted by noise, which severely degrades the performance of data-driven models. Particularly, in chaotic dynamical systems, where small errors amplify rapidly, it is challenging to identify a data-driven model from noisy data that achieves short-term accuracy while preserving long-term invariant properties. In this paper, we propose the use of the weak formulation as a complementary approach to the classical strong formulation of data-driven time-series forecasting models. Specifically, we focus on the neural ordinary differential equation (NODE) architecture. Unlike the standard strong formulation, which relies on the discretization of the NODE followed by optimization, the weak formulation constrains the model using a set of integrated residuals over temporal subdomains. While such a formulation yields an effective NODE model, we discover that the performance of a NODE can be further enhanced by employing this weak formulation as a penalty alongside the classical strong formulation-based learning. Through numerical demonstrations, we illustrate that our proposed training strategy, which we coined as the Weak-Penalty NODE (WP-NODE), achieves state-of-the-art forecasting accuracy and exceptional robustness across benchmark chaotic dynamical systems and real-world climate dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[ResCP: Reservoir Conformal Prediction for Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05060v2)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conformal prediction offers a powerful framework for building distribution-free prediction intervals for exchangeable data. Existing methods that extend conformal prediction to sequential data rely on fitting a relatively complex model to capture temporal dependencies. However, these methods can fail if the sample size is small and often require expensive retraining when the underlying data distribution changes. To overcome these limitations, we propose Reservoir Conformal Prediction (ResCP), a novel training-free conformal prediction method for time series. Our approach leverages the efficiency and representation learning capabilities of reservoir computing to dynamically reweight conformity scores. In particular, we compute similarity scores among reservoir states and use them to adaptively reweight the observed residuals at each step. With this approach, ResCP enables us to account for local temporal dynamics when modeling the error distribution without compromising computational scalability. We prove that, under reasonable assumptions, ResCP achieves asymptotic conditional coverage, and we empirically demonstrate its effectiveness across diverse forecasting tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[DDTime: Dataset Distillation with Spectral Alignment and Information Bottleneck for Time-Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16715v1)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time-series forecasting is fundamental across many domains, yet training accurate models often requires large-scale datasets and substantial computational resources. Dataset distillation offers a promising alternative by synthesizing compact datasets that preserve the learning behavior of full data. However, extending dataset distillation to time-series forecasting is non-trivial due to two fundamental challenges: 1.temporal bias from strong autocorrelation, which leads to distorted value-term alignment between teacher and student models; and 2.insufficient diversity among synthetic samples, arising from the absence of explicit categorical priors to regularize trajectory variety. In this work, we propose DDTime, a lightweight and plug-in distillation framework built upon first-order condensation decomposition. To tackle Challenge 1, it revisits value-term alignment through temporal statistics and introduces a frequency-domain alignment mechanism to mitigate autocorrelation-induced bias, ensuring spectral consistency and temporal fidelity. To address Challenge 2, we further design an inter-sample regularization inspired by the information bottleneck principle, which enhances diversity and maximizes information density across synthetic trajectories. The combined objective is theoretically compatible with a wide range of condensation paradigms and supports stable first-order optimization. Extensive experiments on 20 benchmark datasets and diverse forecasting architectures demonstrate that DDTime consistently outperforms existing distillation methods, achieving about 30% relative accuracy gains while introducing about 2.49% computational overhead. All code and distilled datasets will be released.</p></details> | 36 pages |

However, leveraging such data presents significant challenges due to irregular sampling, complex latent physiology, and inherent uncertainties in both measurements and disease progression. To address these challenges, we propose a generative modeling framework based on latent neural stochastic differential equations (SDEs) that views clinical time series as discrete-time partial observations of an underlying controlled stochastic dynamical system. Our approach models latent dynamics via neural SDEs with modality-dependent emission models, while performing state estimation and parameter learning through variational inference. This formulation naturally handles irregularly sampled observations, learns complex non-linear interactions, and captures the stochasticity of disease progression and measurement noise within a unified scalable probabilistic framework. We validate the framework on two complementary tasks: (i) individual treatment effect estimation using a simulated pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PKPD) model of lung cancer, and (ii) probabilistic forecasting of physiological signals using real-world intensive care unit (ICU) data from 12,000 patients. Results show that our framework outperforms ordinary differential equation and long short-term memory baseline models in accuracy and uncertainty estimation. These results highlight its potential for enabling precise, uncertainty-aware predictions to support clinical decision-making.</p></details> |  |

While recent generative models based on denoising diffusion have advanced state-of-the-art performance in capturing complex data distributions, they suffer from significant computational overhead due to iterative stochastic sampling procedures that limit real-time deployment. Moreover, these models can be brittle when handling high-dimensional, non-stationary, and multi-scale periodic patterns characteristic of real-world sensor networks. We introduce FreqFlow, a novel framework that leverages conditional flow matching in the frequency domain for deterministic MTS forecasting. Unlike conventional approaches that operate in the time domain, FreqFlow transforms the forecasting problem into the spectral domain, where it learns to model amplitude and phase shifts through a single complex-valued linear layer. This frequency-domain formulation enables the model to efficiently capture temporal dynamics via complex multiplication, corresponding to scaling and temporal translations. The resulting architecture is exceptionally lightweight with only 89k parameters - an order of magnitude smaller than competing diffusion-based models-while enabling single-pass deterministic sampling through ordinary differential equation (ODE) integration. Our approach decomposes MTS signals into trend, seasonal, and residual components, with the flow matching mechanism specifically designed for residual learning to enhance long-term forecasting accuracy. Extensive experiments on real-world traffic speed, volume, and flow datasets demonstrate that FreqFlow achieves state-of-the-art forecasting performance, on average 7\% RMSE improvements, while being significantly faster and more parameter-efficient than existing methods</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EurIPS, 2025</p></details> |

Our extensive evaluations demonstrate its superior long-term forecasting performance compared to recent state-of-the-art methods while requiring very little memory. A thorough model analysis provides further insights into its key components and confirms its robustness and effectiveness.

| **[A Hybrid Deep Learning based Carbon Price Forecasting Framework with Structural Breakpoints Detection and Signal Denoising](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04988v2)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately forecasting carbon prices is essential for informed energy market decision-making, guiding sustainable energy planning, and supporting effective decarbonization strategies. However, it remains challenging due to structural breaks and high-frequency noise caused by frequent policy interventions and market shocks. Existing studies, including the most recent baseline approaches, have attempted to incorporate breakpoints but often treat denoising and modeling as separate processes and lack systematic evaluation across advanced deep learning architectures, limiting the robustness and the generalization capability. To address these gaps, this paper proposes a comprehensive hybrid framework that integrates structural break detection (Bai-Perron, ICSS, and PELT algorithms), wavelet signal denoising, and three state-of-the-art deep learning models (LSTM, GRU, and TCN). Using European Union Allowance (EUA) spot prices from 2007 to 2024 and exogenous features such as energy prices and policy indicators, the framework constructs univariate and multivariate datasets for comparative evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed PELT-WT-TCN achieves the highest prediction accuracy, reducing forecasting errors by 22.35% in RMSE and 18.63% in MAE compared to the state-of-the-art baseline model (Breakpoints with Wavelet and LSTM), and by 70.55% in RMSE and 74.42% in MAE compared to the original LSTM without decomposition from the same baseline study. These findings underscore the value of integrating structural awareness and multiscale decomposition into deep learning architectures to enhance accuracy and interpretability in carbon price forecasting and other nonstationary financial time series.</p></details> |  |

The problem with relying on static thresholds is that we are either overspending for more resources than needed or have reduced performance because of their lack. This is why we work on proactive solutions. A framework developed for it stops reacting to the problems but starts expecting them. We design a hybrid architecture, combining two powerful tools: the CNN LSTM model for time series forecasting and an orchestrator based on multi agent Deep Reinforcement Learning In fact the novelty is in how we combine them as we embed the predictive forecast from the CNN LSTM directly into the DRL agent state space. That is what makes the AI manager smarter it sees the future, which allows it to make better decisions about a long term plan for where to run tasks That means finding that sweet spot between how much money is saved while keeping the system healthy and apps fast for users That is we have given it eyes in order to see down the road so that it does not have to lurch from one problem to another it finds a smooth path forward Our tests show our system easily beats the old methods It is great at solving tough problems like making complex decisions and juggling multiple goals at once like being cheap fast and reliable</p></details> |  |

Our approach combines Riemannian least-squares fitting via Bézier curves, empirical covariance on manifolds, and Mahalanobis distance regularization. A key technical contribution is an explicit formula for the gradient of the objective function using adjoint differentials, enabling efficient numerical optimization via Riemannian gradient descent. We validate our framework through synthetic spherical experiments (achieving significant error reduction over unregularized regression) and hurricane forecasting.</p></details> | Extended version |

We show how data, which was not part of the TSFM training data corpus, can be classified without the need of finetuning the model. Examples are represented in the form of targets (class id) and covariates (data matrix) within the prompt of the model, which enables to classify an unknown covariate data pattern alongside the forecast axis through in-context learning. We apply this method to vibration data for assessing the health state of a bearing within a servo-press motor. The method transforms frequency domain reference signals into pseudo time-series patterns, generates aligned covariate and target signals, and uses the TSFM to predict probabilities how classified data corresponds to predefined labels. Leveraging the scalability of pre-trained models this method demonstrates efficacy across varied operational conditions. This marks significant progress beyond custom narrow AI solutions towards broader, AI-driven maintenance systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint submitted to ESANN 2026</p></details> |
| **[TTF: A Trapezoidal Temporal Fusion Framework for LTV Forecasting in Douyin](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17639v1)** | 2025-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the user growth scenario, Internet companies invest heavily in paid acquisition channels to acquire new users. But sustainable growth depends on acquired users' generating lifetime value (LTV) exceeding customer acquisition cost (CAC). In order to maximize LTV/CAC ratio, it is crucial to predict channel-level LTV in an early stage for further optimization of budget allocation. The LTV forecasting problem is significantly different from traditional time series forecasting problems, and there are three main challenges. Firstly, it is an unaligned multi-time series forecasting problem that each channel has a number of LTV series of different activation dates. Secondly, to predict in the early stage, it faces the imbalanced short-input long-output (SILO) challenge. Moreover, compared with the commonly used time series datasets, the real LTV series are volatile and non-stationary, with more frequent fluctuations and higher variance. In this work, we propose a novel framework called Trapezoidal Temporal Fusion (TTF) to address the above challenges. We introduce a trapezoidal multi-time series module to deal with data unalignment and SILO challenges, and output accurate predictions with a multi-tower structure called MT-FusionNet. The framework has been deployed to the online system for Douyin. Compared to the previously deployed online model, MAPEp decreased by 4.3%, and MAPEa decreased by 3.2%, where MAPEp denotes the point-wise MAPE of the LTV curve and MAPEa denotes the MAPE of the aggregated LTV.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI IAAI Track</p></details> |
| **[Multi-layer Stack Ensembles for Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15350v1)** | 2025-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensembling is a powerful technique for improving the accuracy of machine learning models, with methods like stacking achieving strong results in tabular tasks. In time series forecasting, however, ensemble methods remain underutilized, with simple linear combinations still considered state-of-the-art. In this paper, we systematically explore ensembling strategies for time series forecasting. We evaluate 33 ensemble models -- both existing and novel -- across 50 real-world datasets. Our results show that stacking consistently improves accuracy, though no single stacker performs best across all tasks. To address this, we propose a multi-layer stacking framework for time series forecasting, an approach that combines the strengths of different stacker models. We demonstrate that this method consistently provides superior accuracy across diverse forecasting scenarios. Our findings highlight the potential of stacking-based methods to improve AutoML systems for time series forecasting.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at AutoML Conference 2025 Methods Track</p></details> |

Standard reconstruction-based methods, including sequence variational autoencoders (VAEs), use a single latent process and therefore mix heterogeneous time scales, which can smooth out spikes or inflate variances and weaken anomaly separation. In this paper, we present STREAM-VAE, a variational autoencoder for anomaly detection in automotive telemetry time-series data. Our model uses a dual-path encoder to separate slow drift and fast spike signal dynamics, and a decoder that represents transient deviations separately from the normal operating pattern. STREAM-VAE is designed for deployment, producing stable anomaly scores across operating modes for both in-vehicle monitors and backend fleet analytics. Experiments on an automotive telemetry dataset and the public SMD benchmark show that explicitly separating drift and spike dynamics improves robustness compared to strong forecasting, attention, graph, and VAE baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 Pag...</summary><p>8 Pages, 4 Figures, 4 Tables</p></details> |

We introduce FireCastNet, a novel deep learning architecture that combines 3D convolutional encoding with GraphCast-based Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to model complex spatio-temporal dependencies for global wildfire prediction. Our approach leverages the SeasFire dataset, a comprehensive multivariate Earth system datacube containing climate, vegetation, and human-related variables, to forecast burned area patterns up to six months in advance. FireCastNet treats the Earth as an interconnected graph, enabling it to capture both local fire dynamics and long-range teleconnections that influence wildfire behavior across different spatial and temporal scales. Through comprehensive benchmarking against state-of-the-art models including GRU, Conv-GRU, Conv-LSTM, U-TAE, and TeleViT, we demonstrate that FireCastNet achieves superior performance in global burned area forecasting, with particularly strong results in fire-prone regions such as Africa, South America, and Southeast Asia. Our analysis reveals that longer input time-series significantly improve prediction robustness, while spatial context integration enhances model performance across extended forecasting horizons. Additionally, we implement local area modeling techniques that provide enhanced spatial resolution and accuracy for region-specific predictions. These findings highlight the importance of modeling Earth system interactions for long-term wildfire prediction.</p></details> |  |

| **[Adapformer: Adaptive Channel Management for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14632v1)** | 2025-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF), accurately modeling the intricate dependencies among multiple variables remains a significant challenge due to the inherent limitations of traditional approaches. Most existing models adopt either \textbf{channel-independent} (CI) or \textbf{channel-dependent} (CD) strategies, each presenting distinct drawbacks. CI methods fail to leverage the potential insights from inter-channel interactions, resulting in models that may not fully exploit the underlying statistical dependencies present in the data. Conversely, CD approaches often incorporate too much extraneous information, risking model overfitting and predictive inefficiency. To address these issues, we introduce the Adaptive Forecasting Transformer (\textbf{Adapformer}), an advanced Transformer-based framework that merges the benefits of CI and CD methodologies through effective channel management. The core of Adapformer lies in its dual-stage encoder-decoder architecture, which includes the \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{C}hannel \textbf{E}nhancer (\textbf{ACE}) for enriching embedding processes and the \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{C}hannel \textbf{F}orecaster (\textbf{ACF}) for refining the predictions. ACE enhances token representations by selectively incorporating essential dependencies, while ACF streamlines the decoding process by focusing on the most relevant covariates, substantially reducing noise and redundancy. Our rigorous testing on diverse datasets shows that Adapformer achieves superior performance over existing models, enhancing both predictive accuracy and computational efficiency, thus making it state-of-the-art in MTSF.</p></details> |  |
| **[A More Realistic Evaluation of Cross-Frequency Transfer Learning and Foundation Forecasting Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19465v3)** | 2025-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cross-frequency transfer learning (CFTL) has emerged as a popular framework for curating large-scale time series datasets to pre-train foundation forecasting models (FFMs). Although CFTL has shown promise, current benchmarking practices fall short of accurately assessing its performance. This shortcoming stems from many factors: an over-reliance on small-scale evaluation datasets; inadequate treatment of sample size when computing summary statistics; reporting of suboptimal statistical models; and failing to account for non-negligible risks of overlap between pre-training and test datasets. To address these limitations, we introduce a unified reimplementation of widely-adopted neural forecasting networks, adapting them for the CFTL setup; we pre-train only on proprietary and synthetic data, being careful to prevent test leakage; and we evaluate on 15 large, diverse public forecast competition datasets. Our empirical analysis reveals that statistical models' accuracy is frequently underreported. Notably, we confirm that statistical models and their ensembles consistently outperform existing FFMs by more than 8.2% in sCRPS, and by more than 20% MASE, across datasets. However, we also find that synthetic dataset pre-training does improve the accuracy of a FFM by 7% percent.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025 Workshop on Recent Advances in Time Series Foundation Models (BERT2S)</p></details> |
| **[BadTime: An Effective Backdoor Attack on Multivariate Long-Term Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04189v2)** | 2025-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate long-term time series forecasting (MLTSF) models are increasingly deployed in critical domains such as climate, finance, and transportation. Despite their growing importance, the security of MLTSF models against backdoor attacks remains entirely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose BadTime, the first effective backdoor attack tailored for MLTSF. BadTime can manipulate hundreds of future predictions toward a target pattern by injecting a subtle trigger. BadTime addresses two key challenges that arise uniquely in MLTSF: (i) the rapid dilution of local triggers over long horizons, and (ii) the extreme sparsity of backdoor signals under stealth constraints. To counter dilution, BadTime leverages inter-variable correlations, temporal lags, and data-driven initialization to design a distributed, lag-aware trigger that ensures effective influence over long-range forecasts. To overcome sparsity, it introduces a hybrid strategy to select valuable poisoned samples and a decoupled backdoor training objective that adaptively adjusts the model's focus on the sparse backdoor signal, ensuring reliable learning at a poisoning rate as low as 1%. Extensive experiments show that BadTime significantly outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) backdoor attacks on time series forecasting by extending the attackable horizon from at most 12 timesteps to 720 timesteps (a 60-fold improvement), reducing MAE by over 50% on target variables, and boosting stealthiness by more than 3-fold under anomaly detection.</p></details> |  |
| **[A causal interactions indicator between two time series using extreme variations in the first eigenvalue of lagged correlation matrices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04953v3)** | 2025-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a method to identify causal interactions between two time series. The largest eigenvalue follows a Tracy-Widom distribution, derived from a Coulomb gas model. This defines causal interactions as the pushing and pulling of the gas, measurable by the variability of the largest eigenvalue's explanatory power. The hypothesis that this setup applies to time series interactions was validated, with causality inferred from time lags. The standard deviation of the largest eigenvalue's explanatory power in lagged correlation matrices indicated the probability of causal interaction between time series. Contrasting with traditional methods that rely on forecasting or window-based parametric controls, this approach offers a novel definition of causality based on dynamic monitoring of tail events. Experimental validation with controlled trials and historical data shows that this method outperforms Granger's causality test in detecting structural changes in time series. Applications to stock returns and financial market data show the indicator's predictive capabilities regarding average stock return and realized volatility. Further validation with brokerage data confirms its effectiveness in inferring causal relationships in liquidity flows, highlighting its potential for market and liquidity risk management.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 19 Figures, 3 Tables</p></details> |

This study focuses on developing and evaluating time series models for forecasting malaria cases across eight Indian states: Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Maharashtra, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Odisha, Tripura, and Uttar Pradesh. We employed various modeling approaches, including polynomial regression with seasonal components, log-transformed polynomial regression, lagged difference models, and ARIMA models, to capture the temporal dynamics of malaria incidence. Comprehensive model fitting, residual analysis, and performance evaluation using metrics such as Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) indicated that the log-transformed polynomial regression model consistently outperformed other models in terms of accuracy and robustness across all states. Rolling forecast validation further confirmed the superior predictive capability of the log-transformed model over time. Additionally, an interactive R Shiny tool was developed to facilitate the use of these predictive models by researchers and public health officials. This tool allows users to input data, select modeling approaches, and visualize predictions and performance metrics, providing a practical tool for real-time malaria forecasting and decision-making support. Our findings highlight the critical role of appropriate modeling techniques in malaria prediction and offer valuable resources for enhancing malaria surveillance and response efforts.</p></details> | 18 pages |

Accurately forecasting regional Airbnb market trends can thus offer critical insights for policymakers and urban planners aiming to mitigate these impacts. This study proposes a novel time-series forecasting framework to predict three key Airbnb indicators -- Revenue, Reservation Days, and Number of Reservations -- at the regional level. Using a sliding-window approach, the model forecasts trends 1 to 3 months ahead. Unlike prior studies that focus on individual listings at fixed time points, our approach constructs regional representations by integrating listing features with external contextual factors such as urban accessibility and human mobility. We convert structured tabular data into prompt-based inputs for a Large Language Model (LLM), producing comprehensive regional embeddings. These embeddings are then fed into advanced time-series models (RNN, LSTM, Transformer) to better capture complex spatio-temporal dynamics. Experiments on Seoul's Airbnb dataset show that our method reduces both average RMSE and MAE by approximately 48% compared to conventional baselines, including traditional statistical and machine learning models. Our framework not only improves forecasting accuracy but also offers practical insights for detecting oversupplied regions and supporting data-driven urban policy decisions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ASONAM 2025</p></details> |

While recent work has explored horizon selection by preserving forecasting-relevant information in an intrinsic space, these approaches are primarily restricted to centralized and independently distributed settings. This paper presents a principled framework for adaptive horizon selection in federated time series forecasting through an intrinsic space formulation. We introduce a synthetic data generator (SDG) that captures essential temporal structures in client data, including autoregressive dependencies, seasonality, and trend, while incorporating client-specific heterogeneity. Building on this model, we define a transformation that maps time series windows into an intrinsic representation space with well-defined geometric and statistical properties. We then derive a decomposition of the forecasting loss into a Bayesian term, which reflects irreducible uncertainty, and an approximation term, which accounts for finite-sample effects and limited model capacity. Our analysis shows that while increasing the look-back horizon improves the identifiability of deterministic patterns, it also increases approximation error due to higher model complexity and reduced sample efficiency. We prove that the total forecasting loss is minimized at the smallest horizon where the irreducible loss starts to saturate, while the approximation loss continues to rise. This work provides a rigorous theoretical foundation for adaptive horizon selection for time series forecasting in federated learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI-26 as Oral Presentation</p></details> |
| **[Higher-Order Transformers With Kronecker-Structured Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02919v2)** | 2025-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern datasets are increasingly high-dimensional and multiway, often represented as tensor-valued data with multi-indexed variables. While Transformers excel in sequence modeling and high-dimensional tasks, their direct application to multiway data is computationally prohibitive due to the quadratic cost of dot-product attention and the need to flatten inputs, which disrupts tensor structure and cross-dimensional dependencies. We propose the Higher-Order Transformer (HOT), a novel factorized attention framework that represents multiway attention as sums of Kronecker products or sums of mode-wise attention matrices. HOT efficiently captures dense and sparse relationships across dimensions while preserving tensor structure. Theoretically, HOT retains the expressiveness of full high-order attention and allows complexity control via factorization rank. Experiments on 2D and 3D datasets show that HOT achieves competitive performance in multivariate time series forecasting and image classification, with significantly reduced computational and memory costs. Visualizations of mode-wise attention matrices further reveal interpretable high-order dependencies learned by HOT, demonstrating its versatility for complex multiway data across diverse domains. The implementation of our proposed method is publicly available at https://github.com/s-omranpour/HOT.</p></details> |  |

To address this gap, we present a 25-year, daily-resolution wildfire dataset covering 240 million hectares across British Columbia and surrounding regions. The dataset includes 38 covariates, encompassing active fire detections, weather variables, fuel conditions, terrain features, and anthropogenic factors. Using this benchmark, we evaluate a diverse set of time-series forecasting models, including CNN-based, linear-based, Transformer-based, and Mamba-based architectures.

However, these guarantees crucially rely on the assumption of exchangeability. This assumption is fundamentally violated in time series data, where temporal dependence and distributional shifts are pervasive. As a result, classical split-conformal methods may yield prediction intervals that fail to maintain nominal validity. This review unifies recent advances in conformal forecasting methods specifically designed to address nonexchangeable data. We first present a theoretical foundation, deriving finite-sample guarantees for split-conformal prediction under mild weak-dependence conditions. We then survey and classify state-of-the-art approaches that mitigate serial dependence by reweighting calibration data, dynamically updating residual distributions, or adaptively tuning target coverage levels in real time. Finally, we present a comprehensive simulation study that compares these techniques in terms of empirical coverage, interval width, and computational cost, highlighting practical trade-offs and open research directions.</p></details> |  |

Computational efficiency is crucial for scalable reservoir computing, requiring better strategies to reduce training cost. In this work, we uncover a connection between the numerical conditioning of the NGRC feature matrix -- formed by polynomial evaluations on time-delay coordinates -- and the long-term NGRC dynamics. We show that NGRC can be trained without regularization, reducing computational time. Our contributions are twofold. First, merging tools from numerical linear algebra and ergodic theory of dynamical systems, we systematically study how the feature matrix conditioning varies across hyperparameters. We demonstrate that the NGRC feature matrix tends to be ill-conditioned for short time lags, high-degree polynomials, and short length of training data. Second, we evaluate the impact of different numerical algorithms (Cholesky, singular value decomposition (SVD), and lower-upper (LU) decomposition) for solving the regularized least-squares problem. Our results reveal that SVD-based training achieves accurate forecasts without regularization, being preferable when compared against the other algorithms.</p></details> | 23 pages, 14 figures |

The proposed method introduces a bidirectional representation for time series by jointly processing forward and time-reversed input sequences. These representations are then combined through an element-wise (Hadamard) interaction, resulting in a Vedic-inspired encoding that enhances the model's ability to capture temporal dependencies across distant time steps. We evaluate Naga on multiple long-term time series forecasting (LTSF) benchmarks, including ETTh1, ETTh2, ETTm1, ETTm2, Weather, Traffic, and ILI. The experimental results show that Naga outperforms 28 current state of the art models and demonstrates improved efficiency compared to existing deep SSM-based approaches. The findings suggest that incorporating structured, Vedic-inspired decomposition can provide an interpretable and computationally efficient alternative for long-range sequence modeling.</p></details> | submitted to JMLR |

However, most simulation frameworks rely on rule-based or simplified models for scene generation, which lack the fidelity and diversity needed to represent real-world driving. While recent advances in generative modeling produce more realistic and context-aware traffic interactions, they often overlook how social preferences influence driving behavior. SocialDriveGen addresses this gap through a hierarchical framework that integrates semantic reasoning and social preference modeling with generative trajectory synthesis. By modeling egoism and altruism as complementary social dimensions, our framework enables controllable diversity in driver personalities and interaction styles. Experiments on the Argoverse 2 dataset show that SocialDriveGen generates diverse, high-fidelity traffic scenarios spanning cooperative to adversarial behaviors, significantly enhancing policy robustness and generalization to rare or high-risk situations.</p></details> |  |
| **[City-Conditioned Memory for Multi-City Traffic and Mobility Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00851v1)** | 2025-11-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deploying spatio-temporal forecasting models across many cities is difficult: traffic networks differ in size and topology, data availability can vary by orders of magnitude, and new cities may provide only a short history of logs. Existing deep traffic models are typically trained per city and backbone, creating high maintenance cost and poor transfer to data-scarce cities. We ask whether a single, backbone-agnostic layer can condition on "which city this sequence comes from", improve accuracy in full- and low-data regimes, and support better cross-city adaptation with minimal code changes. We propose CityCond, a light-weight city-conditioned memory layer that augments existing spatio-temporal backbones. CityCond combines a city-ID encoder with an optional shared memory bank (CityMem). Given a city index and backbone hidden states, it produces city-conditioned features fused through gated residual connections. We attach CityCond to five representative backbones (GRU, TCN, Transformer, GNN, STGCN) and evaluate three regimes: full-data, low-data, and cross-city few-shot transfer on METR-LA and PEMS-BAY. We also run auxiliary experiments on SIND, a drone-based multi-agent trajectory dataset from a signalized intersection in Tianjin (we focus on pedestrian tracks). Across more than fourteen model variants and three random seeds, CityCond yields consistent improvements, with the largest gains for high-capacity backbones such as Transformers and STGCNs. CityMem reduces Transformer error by roughly one third in full-data settings and brings substantial gains in low-data and cross-city transfer. On SIND, simple city-ID conditioning modestly improves low-data LSTM performance. CityCond can therefore serve as a reusable design pattern for scalable, multi-city forecasting under realistic data constraints.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Outline of Deception: Physical Adversarial Attacks on Traffic Signs Using Edge Patches](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00765v1)** | 2025-11-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Intelligent driving systems are vulnerable to physical adversarial attacks on traffic signs. These attacks can cause misclassification, leading to erroneous driving decisions that compromise road safety. Moreover, within V2X networks, such misinterpretations can propagate, inducing cascading failures that disrupt overall traffic flow and system stability. However, a key limitation of current physical attacks is their lack of stealth. Most methods apply perturbations to central regions of the sign, resulting in visually salient patterns that are easily detectable by human observers, thereby limiting their real-world practicality. This study proposes TESP-Attack, a novel stealth-aware adversarial patch method for traffic sign classification. Based on the observation that human visual attention primarily focuses on the central regions of traffic signs, we employ instance segmentation to generate edge-aligned masks that conform to the shape characteristics of the signs. A U-Net generator is utilized to craft adversarial patches, which are then optimized through color and texture constraints along with frequency domain analysis to achieve seamless integration with the background environment, resulting in highly effective visual concealment. The proposed method demonstrates outstanding attack success rates across traffic sign classification models with varied architectures, achieving over 90% under limited query budgets. It also exhibits strong cross-model transferability and maintains robust real-world performance that remains stable under varying angles and distances.</p></details> |  |
| **[Incorporating Ephemeral Traffic Waves in A Data-Driven Framework for Microsimulation in CARLA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23236v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces a data-driven traffic microsimulation framework in CARLA that reconstructs real-world wave dynamics using high-fidelity time-space data from the I-24 MOTION testbed. Calibration of road networks in microsimulators to reproduce ephemeral phenomena such as traffic waves for large-scale simulation is a process that is fraught with challenges. This work reconsiders the existence of the traffic state data as boundary conditions on an ego vehicle moving through previously recorded traffic data, rather than reproducing those traffic phenomena in a calibrated microsim. Our approach is to autogenerate a 1 mile highway segment corresponding to I-24, and use the I-24 data to power a cosimulation module that injects traffic information into the simulation. The CARLA and cosimulation simulations are centered around an ego vehicle sampled from the empirical data, with autogeneration of "visible" traffic within the longitudinal range of the ego vehicle. Boundary control beyond these visible ranges is achieved using ghost cells behind (upstream) and ahead (downstream) of the ego vehicle. Unlike prior simulation work that focuses on local car-following behavior or abstract geometries, our framework targets full time-space diagram fidelity as the validation objective. Leveraging CARLA's rich sensor suite and configurable vehicle dynamics, we simulate wave formation and dissipation in both low-congestion and high-congestion scenarios for qualitative analysis. The resulting emergent behavior closely mirrors that of real traffic, providing a novel cosimulation framework for evaluating traffic control strategies, perception-driven autonomy, and future deployment of wave mitigation solutions. Our work bridges microscopic modeling with physical experimental data, enabling the first perceptually realistic, boundary-driven simulation of empirical traffic wave phenomena in CARLA.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE IV 2026</p></details> |
| **[Text2Traffic: A Text-to-Image Generation and Editing Method for Traffic Scenes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12932v3)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid advancement of intelligent transportation systems, text-driven image generation and editing techniques have demonstrated significant potential in providing rich, controllable visual scene data for applications such as traffic monitoring and autonomous driving. However, several challenges remain, including insufficient semantic richness of generated traffic elements, limited camera viewpoints, low visual fidelity of synthesized images, and poor alignment between textual descriptions and generated content. To address these issues, we propose a unified text-driven framework for both image generation and editing, leveraging a controllable mask mechanism to seamlessly integrate the two tasks. Furthermore, we incorporate both vehicle-side and roadside multi-view data to enhance the geometric diversity of traffic scenes. Our training strategy follows a two-stage paradigm: first, we perform conceptual learning using large-scale coarse-grained text-image data; then, we fine-tune with fine-grained descriptive data to enhance text-image alignment and detail quality. Additionally, we introduce a mask-region-weighted loss that dynamically emphasizes small yet critical regions during training, thereby substantially enhancing the generation fidelity of small-scale traffic elements. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves leading performance in text-based image generation and editing within traffic scenes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evolutionary Discovery of Heuristic Policies for Traffic Signal Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23122v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic Signal Control (TSC) involves a challenging trade-off: classic heuristics are efficient but oversimplified, while Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) achieves high performance yet suffers from poor generalization and opaque policies. Online Large Language Models (LLMs) provide general reasoning but incur high latency and lack environment-specific optimization. To address these issues, we propose Temporal Policy Evolution for Traffic (\textbf{\method{}}), which uses LLMs as an evolution engine to derive specialized heuristic policies. The framework introduces two key modules: (1) Structured State Abstraction (SSA), converting high-dimensional traffic data into temporal-logical facts for reasoning; and (2) Credit Assignment Feedback (CAF), tracing flawed micro-decisions to poor macro-outcomes for targeted critique. Operating entirely at the prompt level without training, \method{} yields lightweight, robust policies optimized for specific traffic environments, outperforming both heuristics and online LLM actors.</p></details> |  |

Using a novel network algorithm and Mexican census data from 2005 to 2020, we first quantify changes in the strength of domestic and international migration networks across all Mexican municipalities. We exploit variation in local homicide rates, using exogenous fuel price increases and municipalities' proximity to oil pipelines as instruments, to estimate the causal impact of violence on migration. During our study period, following intensified government crackdowns on drug trafficking organizations, many criminal groups fragmented and turned toward large-scale oil theft, driving sharp increases in violence in areas with oil pipelines, particularly when fuel prices rose. The findings show that rising violence increased emigration flows, predominantly within Mexico, and strengthened the intensity of emigration networks both domestically and toward the United States. Although violent municipalities continued to receive new residents, the rise in emigration was larger. Increasing homicide rates led to at least an additional 1.12 million people emigrating domestically and 50,200 fewer Mexicans returning from the United States. Violence also eroded regional connectivity, causing a long-term decline in daily vehicle traffic on highways linking violent areas to the rest of the country.</p></details> |  |
| **[CNN-Based Framework for Pedestrian Age and Gender Classification Using Far-View Surveillance in Mixed-Traffic Intersections](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22873v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pedestrian safety remains a pressing concern in congested urban intersections, particularly in low- and middle-income countries where traffic is multimodal, and infrastructure often lacks formal control. Demographic factors like age and gender significantly influence pedestrian vulnerability, yet real-time monitoring systems rarely capture this information. To address this gap, this study proposes a deep learning framework that classifies pedestrian age group and gender from far-view intersection footage using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), without relying on facial recognition or high-resolution imagery. The classification is structured as a unified six-class problem, distinguishing adult, teenager, and child pedestrians for both males and females, based on full-body visual cues. Video data was collected from three high-risk intersections in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Two CNN architectures were implemented: ResNet50, a deep convolutional neural network pretrained on ImageNet, and a custom lightweight CNN optimized for computational efficiency. Eight model variants explored combinations of pooling strategies and optimizers. ResNet50 with Max Pooling and SGD achieved the highest accuracy (86.19%), while the custom CNN performed comparably (84.15%) with fewer parameters and faster training. The model's efficient design enables real-time inference on standard surveillance feeds. For practitioners, this system provides a scalable, cost-effective tool to monitor pedestrian demographics at intersections using existing camera infrastructure. Its outputs can shape intersection design, optimize signal timing, and enable targeted safety interventions for vulnerable groups such as children or the elderly. By offering demographic insights often missing in conventional traffic data, the framework supports more inclusive, data-driven planning in mixed-traffic environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for poster presentation at the 105th Annual Meeting of the Transportation Research Board</p></details> |
| **[Weaver: Kronecker Product Approximations of Spatiotemporal Attention for Traffic Network Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08888v2)** | 2025-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatiotemporal forecasting on transportation networks is a complex task that requires understanding how traffic nodes interact within a dynamic, evolving system dictated by traffic flow dynamics and social behavioral patterns. The importance of transportation networks and ITS for modern mobility and commerce necessitates forecasting models that are not only accurate but also interpretable, efficient, and robust under structural or temporal perturbations. Recent approaches, particularly Transformer-based architectures, have improved predictive performance but often at the cost of high computational overhead and diminished architectural interpretability. In this work, we introduce Weaver, a novel attention-based model that applies Kronecker product approximations (KPA) to decompose the PN X PN spatiotemporal attention of O(P^2N^2) complexity into local P X P temporal and N X N spatial attention maps. This Kronecker attention map enables our Parallel-Kronecker Matrix-Vector product (P2-KMV) for efficient spatiotemporal message passing with O(P^2N + N^2P) complexity. To capture real-world traffic dynamics, we address the importance of negative edges in modeling traffic behavior by introducing Valence Attention using the continuous Tanimoto coefficient (CTC), which provides properties conducive to precise latent graph generation and training stability. To fully utilize the model's learning capacity, we introduce the Traffic Phase Dictionary for self-conditioning. Evaluations on PEMS-BAY and METR-LA show that Weaver achieves competitive performance across model categories while training more efficiently.</p></details> |  |
| **[Smart Traffic Signals: Comparing MARL and Fixed-Time Strategies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14544v4)** | 2025-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Urban traffic congestion, particularly at intersections, significantly affects travel time, fuel consumption, and emissions. Traditional fixed-time signal control systems often lack the adaptability to effectively manage dynamic traffic patterns. This study explores the application of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to optimize traffic signal coordination across multiple intersections within a simulated environment. A simulation was developed to model a network of interconnected intersections with randomly generated vehicle flows to reflect realistic traffic variability. A decentralized MARL controller was implemented in which each traffic signal operates as an autonomous agent, making decisions based on local observations and information from neighboring agents. Performance was evaluated against a baseline fixed-time controller using metrics such as average vehicle wait time and overall throughput. The MARL approach demonstrated statistically significant improvements, including reduced average waiting times and improved throughput. These findings suggest that MARL-based dynamic control strategies hold substantial promise to improve urban traffic management efficiency. More research is recommended to address the challenges of scalability and real-world implementation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Machine Unlearning of Traffic State Estimation and Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17984v3)** | 2025-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data-driven traffic state estimation and prediction (TSEP) relies heavily on data sources that contain sensitive information. While the abundance of data has fueled significant breakthroughs, particularly in machine learning-based methods, it also raises concerns regarding privacy, cybersecurity, and data freshness. These issues can erode public trust in intelligent transportation systems. Recently, regulations have introduced the "right to be forgotten", allowing users to request the removal of their private data from models. As machine learning models can remember old data, simply removing it from back-end databases is insufficient in such systems. To address these challenges, this study introduces a novel learning paradigm for TSEP-Machine Unlearning TSEP-which enables a trained TSEP model to selectively forget privacy-sensitive, poisoned, or outdated data. By empowering models to "unlearn," we aim to enhance the trustworthiness and reliability of data-driven traffic TSEP.</p></details> |  |

The proposed approach integrates Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) for spatial feature encoding with a latency-driven spike conversion layer and a Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) Spiking Neural Network (SNN) for classification. The Auckland Harbour Bridge dataset is recorded under various weather and lighting conditions, comprising 6,000 labelled frames that include both real and synthetically augmented unsafe cases. The presented system achieves a classification accuracy of 92.3% (+- 0.8%) with a per-frame inference time of 9.5 ms. Achieved sub-10 millisecond latency, combined with sparse spike activity (8.1%), enables real-time, low-power edge deployment. Unlike conventional CNN-based approaches, the hybrid SIFT-SNN pipeline explicitly preserves spatial feature grounding, enhances interpretability, supports transparent decision-making, and operates efficiently on embedded hardware. Although synthetic augmentation improved robustness, generalisation to unseen field conditions remains to be validated. The SIFT-SNN framework is validated through a working prototype deployed on a consumer-grade system and framed as a generalisable case study in structural safety monitoring for movable concrete barriers, which, as a traffic flow-control infrastructure, is deployed in over 20 cities worldwide.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures.

| **[TrafficLens: Multi-Camera Traffic Video Analysis Using LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20965v1)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic cameras are essential in urban areas, playing a crucial role in intelligent transportation systems. Multiple cameras at intersections enhance law enforcement capabilities, traffic management, and pedestrian safety. However, efficiently managing and analyzing multi-camera feeds poses challenges due to the vast amount of data. Analyzing such huge video data requires advanced analytical tools. While Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, equipped with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems, excel in text-based tasks, integrating them into traffic video analysis demands converting video data into text using a Vision-Language Model (VLM), which is time-consuming and delays the timely utilization of traffic videos for generating insights and investigating incidents. To address these challenges, we propose TrafficLens, a tailored algorithm for multi-camera traffic intersections. TrafficLens employs a sequential approach, utilizing overlapping coverage areas of cameras. It iteratively applies VLMs with varying token limits, using previous outputs as prompts for subsequent cameras, enabling rapid generation of detailed textual descriptions while reducing processing time. Additionally, TrafficLens intelligently bypasses redundant VLM invocations through an object-level similarity detector. Experimental results with real-world datasets demonstrate that TrafficLens reduces video-to-text conversion time by up to $4\times$ while maintaining information accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>2024 ...</summary><p>2024 IEEE 27th International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC)</p></details> |

In this paper, we explore the computer vision approach for TSC that modulates on-road traffic flows through visual observation. Unlike traditional feature-based approaches, vision-based methods depend much less on heuristics and predefined features, bringing promising potentials for end-to-end learning and optimization of traffic signals. Thus, we introduce a simple traffic simulation framework called TrafficDojo towards vision-based TSC and its benchmark by integrating the microscopic traffic flow provided in SUMO into the 3D driving simulator MetaDrive. This proposed framework offers a versatile traffic environment for in-depth analysis and comprehensive evaluation of traffic signal controllers across diverse traffic conditions and scenarios. We establish and compare baseline algorithms including both traditional and Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches. This work sheds light on the design and development of vision-based TSC approaches and opens up new research opportunities</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for presentation at the Transportation Research Board (TRB) 105th Annual Meeting</p></details> |
| **[Quantifying the Privacy Implications of High-Fidelity Synthetic Network Traffic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20497v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To address the scarcity and privacy concerns of network traffic data, various generative models have been developed to produce synthetic traffic. However, synthetic traffic is not inherently privacy-preserving, and the extent to which it leaks sensitive information, and how to measure such leakage, remain largely unexplored. This challenge is further compounded by the diversity of model architectures, which shape how traffic is represented and synthesized. We introduce a comprehensive set of privacy metrics for synthetic network traffic, combining standard approaches like membership inference attacks (MIA) and data extraction attacks with network-specific identifiers and attributes. Using these metrics, we systematically evaluate the vulnerability of different representative generative models and examine the factors that influence attack success. Our results reveal substantial variability in privacy risks across models and datasets. MIA success ranges from 0% to 88%, and up to 100% of network identifiers can be recovered from generated traffic, highlighting serious privacy vulnerabilities. We further identify key factors that significantly affect attack outcomes, including training data diversity and how well the generative model fits the training data. These findings provide actionable guidance for designing and deploying generative models that minimize privacy leakage, establishing a foundation for safer synthetic network traffic generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 13 Figures, 6 Tables</p></details> |
| **[Denoising Refinement Diffusion Models for Simultaneous Generation of Multi-scale Mobile Network Traffic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17532v2)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The planning, management, and resource scheduling of cellular mobile networks require joint estimation of mobile traffic across different layers and nodes. Mobile traffic generation can proactively anticipate user demands and capture the dynamics of network load. However, existing methods mainly focus on generating traffic at a single spatiotemporal resolution, making it difficult to jointly model multi-scale traffic patterns. In this paper, we propose ZoomDiff, a diffusion-based model for multi-scale mobile traffic generation. ZoomDiff maps urban environmental context into mobile traffic with multiple spatial and temporal resolutions through a set of customized Denoising Refinement Diffusion Models (DRDM). DRDM employs a multi-stage noise-adding and denoising mechanism, enabling different stages to generate traffic at distinct spatiotemporal resolutions. This design aligns the progressive denoising process with hierarchical network layers, including base stations, cells, and grids of varying granularities. Experiments on real-world mobile traffic datasets show that ZoomDiff achieves at least an 18.4% improvement over state-of-the-art baselines in multi-scale traffic generation tasks. Moreover, ZoomDiff demonstrates strong efficiency and cross-city generalization, highlighting its potential as a powerful generative framework for modeling multi-scale mobile network dynamics.</p></details> |  |
| **[HABIT: Human Action Benchmark for Interactive Traffic in CARLA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19109v1)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current autonomous driving (AD) simulations are critically limited by their inadequate representation of realistic and diverse human behavior, which is essential for ensuring safety and reliability. Existing benchmarks often simplify pedestrian interactions, failing to capture complex, dynamic intentions and varied responses critical for robust system deployment. To overcome this, we introduce HABIT (Human Action Benchmark for Interactive Traffic), a high-fidelity simulation benchmark. HABIT integrates real-world human motion, sourced from mocap and videos, into CARLA (Car Learning to Act, a full autonomous driving simulator) via a modular, extensible, and physically consistent motion retargeting pipeline. From an initial pool of approximately 30,000 retargeted motions, we curate 4,730 traffic-compatible pedestrian motions, standardized in SMPL format for physically consistent trajectories. HABIT seamlessly integrates with CARLA's Leaderboard, enabling automated scenario generation and rigorous agent evaluation. Our safety metrics, including Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) and False Positive Braking Rate (FPBR), reveal critical failure modes in state-of-the-art AD agents missed by prior evaluations. Evaluating three state-of-the-art autonomous driving agents, InterFuser, TransFuser, and BEVDriver, demonstrates how HABIT exposes planner weaknesses that remain hidden in scripted simulations. Despite achieving close or equal to zero collisions per kilometer on the CARLA Leaderboard, the autonomous agents perform notably worse on HABIT, with up to 7.43 collisions/km and a 12.94% AIS 3+ injury risk, and they brake unnecessarily in up to 33% of cases. All components are publicly released to support reproducible, pedestrian-aware AI research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to WACV 2026.

However, existing diffusion and autoregressive approaches are limited by iterative sampling, sequential decoding, or task-specific designs, which hinder efficiency and reuse. We propose Masked Denoising Generation (MDG), a unified generative framework that reformulates multi-agent behavior modeling as the reconstruction of independently noised spatiotemporal tensors. Instead of relying on diffusion time steps or discrete tokenization, MDG applies continuous, per-agent and per-timestep noise masks that enable localized denoising and controllable trajectory generation in a single or few forward passes. This mask-driven formulation generalizes across open-loop prediction, closed-loop simulation, motion planning, and conditional generation within one model. Trained on large-scale real-world driving datasets, MDG achieves competitive closed-loop performance on the Waymo Sim Agents and nuPlan Planning benchmarks, while providing efficient, consistent, and controllable open-loop multi-agent trajectory generation. These results position MDG as a simple yet versatile paradigm for multi-agent behavior modeling.</p></details> |  |

Yet, recognizing traffic signs at night remains challenging due to visual noise and scarcity of public nighttime datasets. Despite advances in vision architectures, existing methods struggle with robustness under low illumination and fail to leverage complementary mutlimodal cues effectively. To overcome these limitations, firstly, we introduce INTSD, a large-scale dataset comprising street-level night-time images of traffic signboards collected across diverse regions of India. The dataset spans 41 traffic signboard classes captured under varying lighting and weather conditions, providing a comprehensive benchmark for both detection and classification tasks. To benchmark INTSD for night-time sign recognition, we conduct extensive evaluations using state-of-the-art detection and classification models. Secondly, we propose LENS-Net, which integrates an adaptive image enhancement detector for joint illumination correction and sign localization, followed by a structured multimodal CLIP-GCNN classifier that leverages cross-modal attention and graph-based reasoning for robust and semantically consistent recognition. Our method surpasses existing frameworks, with ablation studies confirming the effectiveness of its key components. The dataset and code for LENS-Net is publicly available for research.</p></details> |  |

However, accurately estimating flow frequencies is challenging due to the large number of flows and increasing network speeds. Hardware accelerators are often used in this endeavor due to their high computational power, but their limited amount of on-chip memory constrains their performance. Various sketch-based algorithms have been proposed to estimate properties of traffic such as frequency, with lower memory usage and theoretical bounds, but they often under perform with the skewed distribution of network traffic. In this work, we propose an algorithm for top-K identification using a modified TowerSketch and a priority queue array. Tested on real traffic traces, we identify the top-K flows, with K up to 32,768, with a precision of more than 0.94, and estimate their frequency with an average relative error under 1.96%.

Existing coordination methods enable agents to reach consensus without a centralized coordinator, but do not provide formal guarantees on system-level objectives such as efficiency or fairness. To address this limitation, we propose an iterative negotiation and oversight framework that augments a decentralized negotiation mechanism with taxation-like oversight. The framework builds upon the trading auction for consensus, enabling noncooperative agents with conflicting preferences to negotiate through asset trading while preserving valuation privacy. We introduce an oversight mechanism, which implements a taxation-like intervention that guides decentralized negotiation toward system-efficient and equitable outcomes while also regulating how fast the framework converges. We establish theoretical guarantees of finite-time termination and derive bounds linking system efficiency and convergence rate to the level of central intervention. A case study based on the collaborative trajectory options program, a rerouting initiative in U.S. air traffic management, demonstrates that the framework can reliably achieve consensus among noncooperative airspace sector managers, and reveals how the level of intervention regulates the relationship between system efficiency and convergence speed. Taken together, the theoretical and experimental results indicate that the proposed framework provides a general mechanism for decentralized coordination in noncooperative multi-agent systems while safeguarding system-level objectives.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches typically rely on either lane-changing or inter-vehicle gap creation strategies based solely on local or neighboring information, often leading to suboptimal performance in terms of safety and traffic efficiency. In this paper, we present a V2X (vehicle-to-everything communication)-assisted Multiagent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) framework for on-ramp merging that effectively coordinates the complex interplay between lane-changing and inter-vehicle gap adaptation strategies by utilizing zone-specific global information available from a roadside unit (RSU). The merging control problem is formulated as a Multiagent Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (MA-POMDP), where agents leverage both local and global observations through V2X communication. To support both discrete and continuous control decisions, we design a hybrid action space and adopt a parameterized deep Q-learning approach. Extensive simulations, integrating the SUMO traffic simulator and the MOSAIC V2X simulator, demonstrate that our framework significantly improves merging success rate, traffic efficiency, and road safety across diverse traffic scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing LLM-based Autonomous Driving with Modular Traffic Light and Sign Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14391v1)** | 2025-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used for decision-making and planning in autonomous driving, showing promising reasoning capabilities and potential to generalize across diverse traffic situations. However, current LLM-based driving agents lack explicit mechanisms to enforce traffic rules and often struggle to reliably detect small, safety-critical objects such as traffic lights and signs. To address this limitation, we introduce TLS-Assist, a modular redundancy layer that augments LLM-based autonomous driving agents with explicit traffic light and sign recognition. TLS-Assist converts detections into structured natural language messages that are injected into the LLM input, enforcing explicit attention to safety-critical cues. The framework is plug-and-play, model-agnostic, and supports both single-view and multi-view camera setups. We evaluate TLS-Assist in a closed-loop setup on the LangAuto benchmark in CARLA. The results demonstrate relative driving performance improvements of up to 14% over LMDrive and 7% over BEVDriver, while consistently reducing traffic light and sign infractions. We publicly release the code and models on https://github.com/iis-esslingen/TLS-Assist.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unified Low-Light Traffic Image Enhancement via Multi-Stage Illumination Recovery and Adaptive Noise Suppression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17612v1)** | 2025-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Enhancing low-light traffic images is crucial for reliable perception in autonomous driving, intelligent transportation, and urban surveillance systems. Nighttime and dimly lit traffic scenes often suffer from poor visibility due to low illumination, noise, motion blur, non-uniform lighting, and glare from vehicle headlights or street lamps, which hinder tasks such as object detection and scene understanding. To address these challenges, we propose a fully unsupervised multi-stage deep learning framework for low-light traffic image enhancement. The model decomposes images into illumination and reflectance components, progressively refined by three specialized modules: (1) Illumination Adaptation, for global and local brightness correction; (2) Reflectance Restoration, for noise suppression and structural detail recovery using spatial-channel attention; and (3) Over-Exposure Compensation, for reconstructing saturated regions and balancing scene luminance. The network is trained using self-supervised reconstruction, reflectance smoothness, perceptual consistency, and domain-aware regularization losses, eliminating the need for paired ground-truth images. Experiments on general and traffic-specific datasets demonstrate superior performance over state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative metrics (PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS, NIQE) and qualitative visual quality. Our approach enhances visibility, preserves structure, and improves downstream perception reliability in real-world low-light traffic scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Maste...</summary><p>Master's thesis, Korea University, 2025</p></details> |

Traditional centralized machine learning struggles with the distributed data and privacy concerns in these heterogeneous environments, while existing federated learning approaches suffer from high costs and poor generalization. To address these challenges, we propose HFL-FlowLLM, which to our knowledge is the first framework to apply large language models to network traffic flow classification in heterogeneous federated learning. Compared to state-of-the-art heterogeneous federated learning methods for network traffic flow classification, the proposed approach improves the average F1 score by approximately 13%, demonstrating compelling performance and strong robustness. When compared to existing large language models federated learning frameworks, as the number of clients participating in each training round increases, the proposed method achieves up to a 5% improvement in average F1 score while reducing the training costs by about 87%. These findings prove the potential and practical value of HFL-FlowLLM in modern communication networks security.</p></details> |  |

In practice, cyber threats evolve continuously, making the discovery of novel malicious traffic a critical necessity as well as the identification of known classes. Recent studies have advanced this goal with deep models, but they often rely on task-specific architectures that limit transferability and require per-dataset tuning. In this paper we introduce MalRAG, the first LLM driven retrieval-augmented framework for open-set malicious traffic identification. MalRAG freezes the LLM and operates via comprehensive traffic knowledge construction, adaptive retrieval, and prompt engineering. Concretely, we construct a multi-view traffic database by mining prior malicious traffic from content, structural, and temporal perspectives. Furthermore, we introduce a Coverage-Enhanced Retrieval Algorithm that queries across these views to assemble the most probable candidates, thereby improving the inclusion of correct evidence. We then employ Traffic-Aware Adaptive Pruning to select a variable subset of these candidates based on traffic-aware similarity scores, suppressing incorrect matches and yielding reliable retrieved evidence. Moreover, we develop a suite of guidance prompts where task instruction, evidence referencing, and decision guidance are integrated with the retrieved evidence to improve LLM performance. Across diverse real-world datasets and settings, MalRAG delivers state-of-the-art results in both fine-grained identification of known classes and novel malicious traffic discovery.

| **[PAST: A Primary-Auxiliary Spatio-Temporal Network for Traffic Time Series Imputation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13414v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic time series imputation is crucial for the safety and reliability of intelligent transportation systems, while diverse types of missing data, including random, fiber, and block missing make the imputation task challenging. Existing models often focus on disentangling and separately modeling spatial and temporal patterns based on relationships between data points. However, these approaches struggle to adapt to the random missing positions, and fail to learn long-term and large-scale dependencies, which are essential in extensive missing conditions. In this paper, patterns are categorized into two types to handle various missing data conditions: primary patterns, which originate from internal relationships between data points, and auxiliary patterns, influenced by external factors like timestamps and node attributes. Accordingly, we propose the Primary-Auxiliary Spatio-Temporal network (PAST). It comprises a graph-integrated module (GIM) and a cross-gated module (CGM). GIM captures primary patterns via dynamic graphs with interval-aware dropout and multi-order convolutions, and CGM extracts auxiliary patterns through bidirectional gating on embedded external features. The two modules interact via shared hidden vectors and are trained under an ensemble self-supervised framework. Experiments on three datasets under 27 missing data conditions demonstrate that the imputation accuracy of PAST outperforms seven state-of-the-art baselines by up to 26.2% in RMSE and 31.6% in MAE.</p></details> |  |
| **[Descriptor: Distance-Annotated Traffic Perception Question Answering (DTPQA)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13397v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The remarkable progress of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on a variety of tasks has raised interest in their application to automated driving. However, for these models to be trusted in such a safety-critical domain, they must first possess robust perception capabilities, i.e., they must be capable of understanding a traffic scene, which can often be highly complex, with many things happening simultaneously. Moreover, since critical objects and agents in traffic scenes are often at long distances, we require systems with not only strong perception capabilities at close distances (up to 20 meters), but also at long (30+ meters) range. Therefore, it is important to evaluate the perception capabilities of these models in isolation from other skills like reasoning or advanced world knowledge. Distance-Annotated Traffic Perception Question Answering (DTPQA) is a Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmark designed specifically for this purpose: it can be used to evaluate the perception systems of VLMs in traffic scenarios using trivial yet crucial questions relevant to driving decisions. It consists of two parts: a synthetic benchmark (DTP-Synthetic) created using a simulator, and a real-world benchmark (DTP-Real) built on top of existing images of real traffic scenes. Additionally, DTPQA includes distance annotations, i.e., how far the object in question is from the camera. More specifically, each DTPQA sample consists of (at least): (a) an image, (b) a question, (c) the ground truth answer, and (d) the distance of the object in question, enabling analysis of how VLM performance degrades with increasing object distance. In this article, we provide the dataset itself along with the Python scripts used to create it, which can be used to generate additional data of the same kind.</p></details> |  |
| **[T2I-Based Physical-World Appearance Attack against Traffic Sign Recognition Systems in Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12956v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic Sign Recognition (TSR) systems play a critical role in Autonomous Driving (AD) systems, enabling real-time detection of road signs, such as STOP and speed limit signs. While these systems are increasingly integrated into commercial vehicles, recent research has exposed their vulnerability to physical-world adversarial appearance attacks. In such attacks, carefully crafted visual patterns are misinterpreted by TSR models as legitimate traffic signs, while remaining inconspicuous or benign to human observers. However, existing adversarial appearance attacks suffer from notable limitations. Pixel-level perturbation-based methods often lack stealthiness and tend to overfit to specific surrogate models, resulting in poor transferability to real-world TSR systems. On the other hand, text-to-image (T2I) diffusion model-based approaches demonstrate limited effectiveness and poor generalization to out-of-distribution sign types. In this paper, we present DiffSign, a novel T2I-based appearance attack framework designed to generate physically robust, highly effective, transferable, practical, and stealthy appearance attacks against TSR systems. To overcome the limitations of prior approaches, we propose a carefully designed attack pipeline that integrates CLIP-based loss and masked prompts to improve attack focus and controllability. We also propose two novel style customization methods to guide visual appearance and improve out-of-domain traffic sign attack generalization and attack stealthiness. We conduct extensive evaluations of DiffSign under varied real-world conditions, including different distances, angles, light conditions, and sign categories. Our method achieves an average physical-world attack success rate of 83.3%, leveraging DiffSign's high effectiveness in attack transferability.</p></details> | 16 pages, 12 figures |

Most existing methods for traffic signal modeling often rely on the original data modality, i.e., numerical direct readings from the sensors in cities. However, this unimodal approach overlooks the semantic information existing in multimodal heterogeneous urban data in different perspectives, which hinders a comprehensive understanding of traffic signals and limits the accurate prediction of complex traffic dynamics. To address this problem, we propose a novel Multimodal framework, MTP, for urban Traffic Profiling, which learns multimodal features through numeric, visual, and textual perspectives. The three branches drive for a multimodal perspective of urban traffic signal learning in the frequency domain, while the frequency learning strategies delicately refine the information for extraction. Specifically, we first conduct the visual augmentation for the traffic signals, which transforms the original modality into frequency images and periodicity images for visual learning. Also, we augment descriptive texts for the traffic signals based on the specific topic, background information and item description for textual learning. To complement the numeric information, we utilize frequency multilayer perceptrons for learning on the original modality. We design a hierarchical contrastive learning on the three branches to fuse the spectrum of three modalities. Finally, extensive experiments on six real-world datasets demonstrate superior performance compared with the state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> |  |

We present CareNet, a router-centric system that transforms household network metadata into interpretable behavioral indicators aligned with DSM-5 depressive-symptom domains. All processing occurs locally at the home gateway, preserving privacy while maintaining visibility of temporal routines. The core contribution is the Fuzzy Additive Symptom Likelihood (FASL), a transparent formulation that fuses header-level metrics into daily criterion-level likelihoods using bounded fuzzy memberships and additive aggregation. Combined with a DSM-style temporal gate, FASL integrates short-term traffic fluctuations into persistent, clinically interpretable indicators. Evaluation on realistic multi-day traces shows that CareNet captures characteristic patterns such as delayed sleep timing and attentional instability without payload inspection. The results highlight the feasibility of reproducible, explainable behavioral inference from router-side telemetry.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quantifying Distribution Shift in Traffic Signal Control with Histogram-Based GEH Distance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13785v1)** | 2025-11-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic signal control algorithms are vulnerable to distribution shift, where performance degrades under traffic conditions that differ from those seen during design or training. This paper introduces a principled approach to quantify distribution shift by representing traffic scenarios as demand histograms and comparing them with a GEH-based distance function. The method is policy-independent, interpretable, and leverages a widely used traffic engineering statistic. We validate the approach on 20 simulated scenarios using both a NEMA actuated controller and a reinforcement learning controller (FRAP++). Results show that larger scenario distances consistently correspond to increased travel time and reduced throughput, with particularly strong explanatory power for learning-based control. Overall, this method can predict performance degradation under distribution shift better than previously published techniques. These findings highlight the utility of the proposed framework for benchmarking, training regime design, and monitoring in adaptive traffic signal control.</p></details> |  |
| **[HyperD: Hybrid Periodicity Decoupling Framework for Traffic Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09275v2)** | 2025-11-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate traffic forecasting plays a vital role in intelligent transportation systems, enabling applications such as congestion control, route planning, and urban mobility optimization. However, traffic forecasting remains challenging due to two key factors: (1) complex spatial dependencies arising from dynamic interactions between road segments and traffic sensors across the network, and (2) the coexistence of multi-scale periodic patterns (e.g., daily and weekly periodic patterns driven by human routines) with irregular fluctuations caused by unpredictable events (e.g., accidents, weather, or construction). To tackle these challenges, we propose HyperD (Hybrid Periodic Decoupling), a novel framework that decouples traffic data into periodic and residual components. The periodic component is handled by the Hybrid Periodic Representation Module, which extracts fine-grained daily and weekly patterns using learnable periodic embeddings and spatial-temporal attention. The residual component, which captures non-periodic, high-frequency fluctuations, is modeled by the Frequency-Aware Residual Representation Module, leveraging complex-valued MLP in frequency domain. To enforce semantic separation between the two components, we further introduce a Dual-View Alignment Loss, which aligns low-frequency information with the periodic branch and high-frequency information with the residual branch. Extensive experiments on four real-world traffic datasets demonstrate that HyperD achieves state-of-the-art prediction accuracy, while offering superior robustness under disturbances and improved computational efficiency compared to existing methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Ground Plane Projection for Improved Traffic Analytics at Intersections](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12342v1)** | 2025-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate turning movement counts at intersections are important for signal control, traffic management and urban planning. Computer vision systems for automatic turning movement counts typically rely on visual analysis in the image plane of an infrastructure camera. Here we explore potential advantages of back-projecting vehicles detected in one or more infrastructure cameras to the ground plane for analysis in real-world 3D coordinates. For single-camera systems we find that back-projection yields more accurate trajectory classification and turning movement counts. We further show that even higher accuracy can be achieved through weak fusion of back-projected detections from multiple cameras. These results suggeest that traffic should be analyzed on the ground plane, not the image plane</p></details> |  |
| **[CATS-V2V: A Real-World Vehicle-to-Vehicle Cooperative Perception Dataset with Complex Adverse Traffic Scenarios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11168v1)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) cooperative perception has great potential to enhance autonomous driving performance by overcoming perception limitations in complex adverse traffic scenarios (CATS). Meanwhile, data serves as the fundamental infrastructure for modern autonomous driving AI. However, due to stringent data collection requirements, existing datasets focus primarily on ordinary traffic scenarios, constraining the benefits of cooperative perception. To address this challenge, we introduce CATS-V2V, the first-of-its-kind real-world dataset for V2V cooperative perception under complex adverse traffic scenarios. The dataset was collected by two hardware time-synchronized vehicles, covering 10 weather and lighting conditions across 10 diverse locations. The 100-clip dataset includes 60K frames of 10 Hz LiDAR point clouds and 1.26M multi-view 30 Hz camera images, along with 750K anonymized yet high-precision RTK-fixed GNSS and IMU records. Correspondingly, we provide time-consistent 3D bounding box annotations for objects, as well as static scenes to construct a 4D BEV representation. On this basis, we propose a target-based temporal alignment method, ensuring that all objects are precisely aligned across all sensor modalities. We hope that CATS-V2V, the largest-scale, most supportive, and highest-quality dataset of its kind to date, will benefit the autonomous driving community in related tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Strada-LLM: Graph LLM for traffic prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20856v3)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic forecasting is pivotal for intelligent transportation systems, where accurate and interpretable predictions can significantly enhance operational efficiency and safety. A key challenge stems from the heterogeneity of traffic conditions across diverse locations, leading to highly varied traffic data distributions. Large language models (LLMs) show exceptional promise for few-shot learning in such dynamic and data-sparse scenarios. However, existing LLM-based solutions often rely on prompt-tuning, which can struggle to fully capture complex graph relationships and spatiotemporal dependencies-thereby limiting adaptability and interpretability in real-world traffic networks. We address these gaps by introducing Strada-LLM, a novel multivariate probabilistic forecasting LLM that explicitly models both temporal and spatial traffic patterns. By incorporating proximal traffic information as covariates, Strada-LLM more effectively captures local variations and outperforms prompt-based existing LLMs. To further enhance adaptability, we propose a lightweight distribution-derived strategy for domain adaptation, enabling parameter-efficient model updates when encountering new data distributions or altered network topologies-even under few-shot constraints. Empirical evaluations on spatio-temporal transportation datasets demonstrate that Strada-LLM consistently surpasses state-of-the-art LLM-driven and traditional GNN-based predictors. Specifically, it improves long-term forecasting by 17% in RMSE error and 16% more efficiency. Moreover, it maintains robust performance across different LLM backbones with minimal degradation, making it a versatile and powerful solution for real-world traffic prediction tasks.</p></details> | 13 pages |
| **[Advanced Tool for Traffic Crash Analysis: An AI-Driven Multi-Agent Approach to Pre-Crash Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10853v1)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic collision reconstruction traditionally relies on human expertise, often yielding inconsistent results when analyzing incomplete multimodal data. This study develops a multi-agent AI framework that reconstructs pre-crash scenarios and infers vehicle behaviors from fragmented collision data. We present a two-phase collaborative framework combining reconstruction and reasoning phases. The system processes 277 rear-end lead vehicle deceleration (LVD) collisions from the Crash Investigation Sampling System, integrating textual crash reports, structured tabular data, and visual scene diagrams. Phase I generates natural-language crash reconstructions from multimodal inputs. Phase II performs in-depth crash reasoning by combining these reconstructions with temporal Event Data Recorder (EDR).For validation, we applied it to all LVD cases, focusing on a subset of 39 complex crashes where multiple EDR records per collision introduced ambiguity (e.g., due to missing or conflicting data).The evaluation of the 39 LVD crash cases revealed our framework achieved perfect accuracy across all test cases, successfully identifying both the most relevant EDR event and correctly distinguishing striking versus struck vehicles, surpassing the 92% accuracy achieved by human researchers on the same challenging dataset. The system maintained robust performance even when processing incomplete data, including missing or erroneous EDR records and ambiguous scene diagrams. This study demonstrates superior AI capabilities in processing heterogeneous collision data, providing unprecedented precision in reconstructing impact dynamics and characterizing pre-crash behaviors.</p></details> | 26 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Unlocking Dynamic Inter-Client Spatial Dependencies: A Federated Spatio-Temporal Graph Learning Method for Traffic Flow Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10434v1)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal graphs are powerful tools for modeling complex dependencies in traffic time series. However, the distributed nature of real-world traffic data across multiple stakeholders poses significant challenges in modeling and reconstructing inter-client spatial dependencies while adhering to data locality constraints. Existing methods primarily address static dependencies, overlooking their dynamic nature and resulting in suboptimal performance. In response, we propose Federated Spatio-Temporal Graph with Dynamic Inter-Client Dependencies (FedSTGD), a framework designed to model and reconstruct dynamic inter-client spatial dependencies in federated learning. FedSTGD incorporates a federated nonlinear computation decomposition module to approximate complex graph operations. This is complemented by a graph node embedding augmentation module, which alleviates performance degradation arising from the decomposition. These modules are coordinated through a client-server collective learning protocol, which decomposes dynamic inter-client spatial dependency learning tasks into lightweight, parallelizable subtasks. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that FedSTGD achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art baselines in terms of RMSE, MAE, and MAPE, approaching that of centralized baselines. Ablation studies confirm the contribution of each module in addressing dynamic inter-client spatial dependencies, while sensitivity analysis highlights the robustness of FedSTGD to variations in hyperparameters.</p></details> |  |

While existing attack vectors demonstrate security concerns, they suffer from visual detectability or implementation constraints, suggesting unexplored vulnerability surfaces in TSR systems. We introduce the Adversarial Retroreflective Patch (ARP), a novel attack vector that combines the high deployability of patch attacks with the stealthiness of laser projections by utilizing retroreflective materials activated only under victim headlight illumination. We develop a retroreflection simulation method and employ black-box optimization to maximize attack effectiveness. ARP achieves $\geq$93.4\% success rate in dynamic scenarios at 35 meters and $\geq$60\% success rate against commercial TSR systems in real-world conditions. Our user study demonstrates that ARP attacks maintain near-identical stealthiness to benign signs while achieving $\geq$1.9\% higher stealthiness scores than previous patch attacks. We propose the DPR Shield defense, employing strategically placed polarized filters, which achieves $\geq$75\% defense success rates for stop signs and speed limit signs against micro-prism patches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Leader-Follower Identification Methodology for Non-Lane Disciplined Heterogeneous Traffic Using Steady State Features](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09946v1)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Road traffic in developing countries, such as India, features a heterogeneous mix of vehicles operating under weak lane discipline (HWLD), encompassing both motorised and non-motorised modes with diverse sizes and manoeuvrability. These conditions lead to complex driver interactions, complicating the reliable identification of vehicle-following (VF) behaviour and leader-follower (LF) pairs. Traditional identification methods based on fixed thresholds for longitudinal and lateral proximity often misclassify non-following instances as valid LF pairs, degrading model performance. This study presents a refined and adaptive method for LF identification in HWLD traffic. It employs vehicle-type- and speed-specific desirable gap thresholds derived from the fundamental density-speed diagram to eliminate false-positive pairs. Additionally, Mexican Hat Wavelet Transform (MWT) is employed to analyse LV and SV speed profiles, verifying LV-SV interaction for LF pair identification. The three-stage filtering includes: (i) speed-gap consistency, (ii) approach/diverge detection via relative velocity sign changes and gap range, and (iii) wavelet-based speed correlation using MWT to confirm LV influence on SV. The framework effectively filters out LF pairs associated with overtaking, tailgating, and inconsistent gap dynamics, retaining only those with consistent VF behaviour and improving model accuracy. Analysis across thirteen LF combinations shows that VF dynamics depend on both SV and LV types. Symmetric pairs (e.g., CAR-CAR, AUTO-CAR) exhibit higher predictability and lower errors, while asymmetric pairs with heavy vehicles or two-wheelers show greater variability. The framework offers a robust foundation for traffic modelling and behaviour analysis.</p></details> |  |

Existing datasets, focused on detection and localization, lack the annotations required for this legal reasoning. To bridge this gap, we introduce the \textbf{C}hinese \textbf{A}ccident \textbf{D}uty-determination \textbf{D}ataset (\textbf{CADD}), the first benchmark for statute-based liability attribution. CADD contains 792 real-world driving recorder videos, each annotated within a novel \textbf{``Behavior--Liability--Statute''} pipeline. This framework provides \textbf{granular, symmetric behavior annotations}, clear responsibility assignments, and, uniquely, links each case to the specific \textbf{Chinese traffic law statute} violated. We demonstrate the utility of CADD through detailed analysis and establish benchmarks for liability prediction and explainable decision-making. By directly connecting perceptual data to legal consequences, CADD provides a foundational resource for developing accountable and legally-grounded autonomous systems.</p></details> |  |

An Extensive Approach Considering Statistical, Machine Learning and Deep Learning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09450v1)** | 2025-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With rapid urbanization in recent decades, traffic congestion has intensified due to increased movement of people and goods. As planning shifts from demand-based to supply-oriented strategies, Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) have become essential for managing traffic within existing infrastructure. A core ITS function is traffic forecasting, enabling proactive measures like ramp metering, signal control, and dynamic routing through platforms such as Google Maps. This study assesses the performance of statistical, machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) models in forecasting traffic speed and flow using real-world data from California's Harbor Freeway, sourced from the Caltrans Performance Measurement System (PeMS). Each model was evaluated over 20 forecasting windows (up to 1 hour 40 minutes) using RMSE, MAE, and R-Square metrics. Results show ANFIS-GP performs best at early windows with RMSE of 0.038, MAE of 0.0276, and R-Square of 0.9983, while Bi-LSTM is more robust for medium-term prediction due to its capacity to model long-range temporal dependencies, achieving RMSE of 0.1863, MAE of 0.0833, and R-Square of 0.987 at a forecasting of 20. The degradation in model performance was quantified using logarithmic transformation, with slope values used to measure robustness. Among DL models, Bi-LSTM had the flattest slope (0.0454 RMSE, 0.0545 MAE for flow), whereas ANFIS-GP had 0.1058 for RMSE and 0.1037 for flow MAE. The study concludes by identifying hybrid models as a promising future direction.</p></details> | <details><summary>6,227...</summary><p>6,227 words text + 2*250 (2 tables) = 6,727 words</p></details> |

A core technology for analyzing such images, associated with spatiotemporal information, is Traffic Scene Understanding (TSU), which aims to provide a comprehensive description of the traffic scene. Unlike traditional spatio-temporal data analysis tasks, the dependence on both spatio-temporal and visual-textual data introduces distinct challenges to TSU task. However, recent research often treats TSU as a common image understanding task, ignoring the spatio-temporal information and overlooking the interrelations between different aspects of the traffic scene. To address these issues, we propose a novel SpatioTemporal Enhanced Model based on CILP (ST-CLIP) for TSU. Our model uses the classic vision-language model, CLIP, as the backbone, and designs a Spatio-temporal Context Aware Multiaspect Prompt (SCAMP) learning method to incorporate spatiotemporal information into TSU. The prompt learning method consists of two components: A dynamic spatio-temporal context representation module that extracts representation vectors of spatio-temporal data for each traffic scene image, and a bi-level ST-aware multi-aspect prompt learning module that integrates the ST-context representation vectors into word embeddings of prompts for the CLIP model. The second module also extracts low-level visual features and image-wise high-level semantic features to exploit interactive relations among different aspects of traffic scenes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to integrate spatio-temporal information into visionlanguage models to facilitate TSU task. Experiments on two realworld datasets demonstrate superior performance in the complex scene understanding scenarios with a few-shot learning strategy.</p></details> |  |

These limitations pose significant challenges for the efficient deployment and operation of deep learning models on large-scale datasets. To address these challenges, we propose a cost-effective graph-free Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) based model M3-Net for traffic prediction. Our proposed model not only employs time series and spatio-temporal embeddings for efficient feature processing but also first introduces a novel MLP-Mixer architecture with a mixture of experts (MoE) mechanism.

Macroscopic emission fundamental diagram (eMFD)captures an orderly relationship among emission and aggregated traffic variables at the network level, allowing for real-time monitoring of region-wide emissions and optimal allocation of travel demand to existing networks, reducing urban congestion and associated emissions. However, empirically derived eMFD models are sparse due to historical data limitation. Leveraging a large-scale and granular traffic and emission data derived from probe vehicles, this study is the first to apply machine learning methods to predict the network wide emission rate to traffic relationship in U.S. urban areas at a large scale. The analysis framework and insights developed in this work generate data-driven eMFDs and a deeper understanding of their location dependence on network, infrastructure, land use, and vehicle characteristics, enabling transportation authorities to measure carbon emissions from urban transport of given travel demand and optimize location specific traffic management and planning decisions to mitigate network-wide emissions.</p></details> | <details><summary>3 pag...</summary><p>3 pages, 5 figures, IEEE Big Data 2024 conference</p></details> |

However, it can be difficult to accurately represent the complex traffic patterns of an attack, especially in Internet-of-Things (IoT) networks. This paper studies the impact that seemingly similar features created by different network traffic flow exporters can have on the generalization and robustness of ML models. In addition to the original CSV files of the Bot-IoT, IoT-23, and CICIoT23 datasets, the raw network packets of their PCAP files were analysed with the HERA tool, generating new labelled flows and extracting consistent features for new CSV versions. To assess the usefulness of these new flows for intrusion detection, they were compared with the original versions and were used to fine-tune multiple models. Overall, the results indicate that directly analysing and preprocessing PCAP files, instead of just using the commonly available CSV files, enables the computation of more relevant features to train bagging and gradient boosting decision tree ensembles. It is important to continue improving feature extraction and feature selection processes to make different datasets more compatible and enable a trustworthy evaluation and comparison of the ML models used in cybersecurity solutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 12 tables, 1 figure, FPS 2025 conference</p></details> |

The problem is complex due to the intricate spatial and temporal interdependence among regions. Prior works study the spatial and temporal dependency in a decouple manner, failing to capture their joint effect. In this work, we propose ST-SAM, a novel and efficient Spatial-Temporal Self-Attention Model for traffic forecasting. ST-SAM uses a region embedding layer to learn time-specific embedding from traffic data for regions. Then, it employs a spatial-temporal dependency learning module based on self-attention mechanism to capture the joint spatial-temporal dependency for both nearby and faraway regions. ST-SAM entirely relies on self-attention to capture both local and global spatial-temporal correlations, which make it effective and efficient. Extensive experiments on two real world datasets show that ST-SAM is substantially more accurate and efficient than the state-of-the-art approaches (with an average improvement of up to 15% on RMSE, 17% on MAPE, and 32 times on training time in our experiments).</p></details> | 5 pages |

In our approach, each robot autonomously plans its path and shares this information with a centralized node. The centralized system detects potential conflicts and allows only one of the conflicting robots to proceed at a time, instructing others to stop outside the conflicting area to avoid deadlocks. Unlike traditional centralized planning methods, our system does not dictate robot paths but instead provides stop commands, functioning as a virtual traffic light. In simulation experiments with multiple robots, our approach increased the success rate of robots reaching their goals while reducing deadlocks.

Existing machine learning (ML)-based approaches, typically trained on static single-domain datasets, often fail to generalize across heterogeneous network environments. To address this gap, we develop a realistic Docker-NS3-based testbed that emulates both IoT and traditional traffic conditions, enabling the generation and capture of live, labeled network flows. The resulting M-En Dataset combines this traffic with curated public PCAP traces to provide comprehensive coverage of benign and malicious behaviors. Building on this foundation, we propose Multi-LF, a real-time continuous learning framework that combines a lightweight model (M1) for rapid detection with a deeper model (M2) for high-confidence refinement and adaptation. A confidence-based coordination mechanism enhances efficiency without compromising accuracy, while weight interpolation mitigates catastrophic forgetting during continuous updates. Features extracted at 1-second intervals capture fine-grained temporal patterns, enabling early recognition of evolving attack behaviors. Implemented and evaluated within the Docker-NS3 testbed on live traffic, Multi-LF achieves an accuracy of 0.999 while requiring human intervention for only 0.0026 percent of packets, demonstrating its effectiveness and practicality for real-time malicious traffic detection in heterogeneous network environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This version (v2) corresponds to the revised manuscript submitted to the Journal of Network and Computer Applications (Elsevier).

| **[Convergence of Multiagent Learning Systems for Traffic control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11654v1)** | 2025-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rapid urbanization in cities like Bangalore has led to severe traffic congestion, making efficient Traffic Signal Control (TSC) essential. Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), often modeling each traffic signal as an independent agent using Q-learning, has emerged as a promising strategy to reduce average commuter delays. While prior work Prashant L A et. al has empirically demonstrated the effectiveness of this approach, a rigorous theoretical analysis of its stability and convergence properties in the context of traffic control has not been explored. This paper bridges that gap by focusing squarely on the theoretical basis of this multi-agent algorithm. We investigate the convergence problem inherent in using independent learners for the cooperative TSC task. Utilizing stochastic approximation methods, we formally analyze the learning dynamics. The primary contribution of this work is the proof that the specific multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm for traffic control is proven to converge under the given conditions extending it from single agent convergence proofs for asynchronous value iteration.</p></details> | 14 pages 2 figures |

Toward this, a distributed observable state-space model is derived, which paves the way for estimation and observability analysis of HDVs in mixed traffic scenarios. In this direction, first, we obtain the condition on the network topology to satisfy the distributed observability, i.e., the condition such that each HDV state is observable to every CAV via information-exchange over the network. It is shown that strong connectivity of the network, along with the proper design of the observer gain, is sufficient for this. A distributed observer is then designed by locally sharing estimates/observations of each CAV with its neighborhood. Second, in case there exist faulty sensors or unreliable observation data, we derive the condition for redundant distributed observability as a $q$-node/link-connected network design. This redundancy is achieved by extra information-sharing over the network and implies that a certain number of faulty sensors and unreliable links can be isolated/removed without losing the observability. Simulation results are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>EURAS...</summary><p>EURASIP journal on advances in signal processing</p></details> |

FedNET employs Federated Learning (FL) to model the temporal evolution of node-level traffic in a distributed manner, enabling accurate multi-step-ahead predictions (e.g., several hours to days) without exposing sensitive network data. Using these node-level forecasts and known routing information, FedNET estimates the future link-level utilization by aggregating traffic contributions across all source-destination pairs. The links are then ranked according to the predicted load intensity and temporal variability, providing an early warning signal for potential high-risk links. We compare the federated traffic prediction of FedNET against a centralized multi-step learning baseline and then systematically analyze the impact of history and prediction window sizes on forecast accuracy using the $R^2$ score. Results indicate that FL achieves accuracy close to centralized training, with shorter prediction horizons consistently yielding the highest accuracy ($R^2 >0.92$), while longer horizons providing meaningful forecasts ($R^2 \approx 0.45\text{--}0.55$). We further validate the efficacy of the FedNET framework in predicting network utilization on a realistic network topology and demonstrate that it consistently identifies high-risk links well in advance (i.e., three days ahead) of the critical stress states emerging, making it a practical tool for anticipatory traffic engineering and capacity planning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Automated Vehicles at Unsignalized Intersections: Safety and Efficiency Implications of Mixed Human and Automated Traffic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12538v3)** | 2025-11-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of automated vehicles (AVs) into transportation systems presents an unprecedented opportunity to enhance road safety and efficiency. However, understanding the interactions between AVs and human-driven vehicles (HVs) at intersections remains an open research question. This study aims to bridge this gap by examining behavioral differences and adaptations of AVs and HVs at unsignalized intersections by utilizing two large-scale AV datasets from Waymo and Lyft. By using a systematic methodology, the research identifies and analyzes merging and crossing conflicts by calculating key safety and efficiency metrics, including time to collision (TTC), post-encroachment time (PET), maximum required deceleration (MRD), time advantage (TA), and speed and acceleration profiles. Through this approach, the study assesses the safety and efficiency implications of these behavioral differences and adaptations for mixed-autonomy traffic. The findings reveal a paradox: while AVs maintain larger safety margins, their conservative behavior can lead to unexpected situations for human drivers, potentially causing unsafe conditions. From a performance point of view, human drivers tend to exhibit more consistent behavior when interacting with AVs versus other HVs, suggesting AVs may contribute to harmonizing traffic flow patterns. Moreover, notable differences were observed between Waymo and Lyft vehicles, which highlights the importance of considering manufacturer-specific AV behaviors in traffic modeling and management strategies for the safe integration of AVs. The processed dataset, as well as the developed algorithms and scripts, are openly published to foster research on AV-HV interactions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published OnlineFirst in Transportation Research Record (TRR), DOI: 10.1177/03611981251370343</p></details> |
| **[Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning for Fair and Efficient Urban Traffic Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06363v1)** | 2025-11-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The optimization of urban traffic is threatened by the complexity of achieving a balance between transport efficiency and the maintenance of privacy, as well as the equitable distribution of traffic based on socioeconomically diverse neighborhoods. Current centralized traffic management schemes invade user location privacy and further entrench traffic disparity by offering disadvantaged route suggestions, whereas current federated learning frameworks do not consider fairness constraints in multi-objective traffic settings. This study presents a privacy-preserving federated learning framework, termed FedFair-Traffic, that jointly and simultaneously optimizes travel efficiency, traffic fairness, and differential privacy protection. This is the first attempt to integrate three conflicting objectives to improve urban transportation systems. The proposed methodology enables collaborative learning between related vehicles with data locality by integrating Graph Neural Networks with differential privacy mechanisms ($ε$-privacy guarantees) and Gini coefficient-based fair constraints using multi-objective optimization. The framework uses federated aggregation methods of gradient clipping and noise injection to provide differential privacy and optimize Pareto-efficient solutions for the efficiency-fairness tradeoff. Real-world comprehensive experiments on the METR-LA traffic dataset showed that FedFair-Traffic can reduce the average travel time by 7\% (14.2 minutes) compared with their centralized baselines, promote traffic fairness by 73\% (Gini coefficient, 0.78), and offer high privacy protection (privacy score, 0.8) with an 89\% reduction in communication overhead. These outcomes demonstrate that FedFair-Traffic is a scalable privacy-aware smart city infrastructure with possible use-cases in metropolitan traffic flow control and federated transportation networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review at IEEE journal</p></details> |
| **[LLM-Guided Reinforcement Learning with Representative Agents for Traffic Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06260v1)** | 2025-11-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as behavioral proxies for self-interested travelers in agent-based traffic models. Although more flexible and generalizable than conventional models, the practical use of these approaches remains limited by scalability due to the cost of calling one LLM for every traveler. Moreover, it has been found that LLM agents often make opaque choices and produce unstable day-to-day dynamics. To address these challenges, we propose to model each homogeneous traveler group facing the same decision context with a single representative LLM agent who behaves like the population's average, maintaining and updating a mixed strategy over routes that coincides with the group's aggregate flow proportions. Each day, the LLM reviews the travel experience and flags routes with positive reinforcement that they hope to use more often, and an interpretable update rule then converts this judgment into strategy adjustments using a tunable (progressively decaying) step size. The representative-agent design improves scalability, while the separation of reasoning from updating clarifies the decision logic while stabilizing learning. In classic traffic assignment settings, we find that the proposed approach converges rapidly to the user equilibrium. In richer settings with income heterogeneity, multi-criteria costs, and multi-modal choices, the generated dynamics remain stable and interpretable, reproducing plausible behavioral patterns well-documented in psychology and economics, for example, the decoy effect in toll versus non-toll road selection, and higher willingness-to-pay for convenience among higher-income travelers when choosing between driving, transit, and park-and-ride options.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep Reinforcement Learning for Dynamic Origin-Destination Matrix Estimation in Microscopic Traffic Simulations Considering Credit Assignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06229v1)** | 2025-11-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper focuses on dynamic origin-destination matrix estimation (DODE), a crucial calibration process necessary for the effective application of microscopic traffic simulations. The fundamental challenge of the DODE problem in microscopic simulations stems from the complex temporal dynamics and inherent uncertainty of individual vehicle dynamics. This makes it highly challenging to precisely determine which vehicle traverses which link at any given moment, resulting in intricate and often ambiguous relationships between origin-destination (OD) matrices and their contributions to resultant link flows. This phenomenon constitutes the credit assignment problem, a central challenge addressed in this study. We formulate the DODE problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and propose a novel framework that applies model-free deep reinforcement learning (DRL). Within our proposed framework, the agent learns an optimal policy to sequentially generate OD matrices, refining its strategy through direct interaction with the simulation environment. The proposed method is validated on the Nguyen-Dupuis network using SUMO, where its performance is evaluated against ground-truth link flows aggregated at 5-minute intervals over a 30-minute horizon. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves a 43.2% reduction in mean squared error (MSE) compared to the best-performing conventional baseline. By reframing DODE as a sequential decision-making problem, our approach addresses the credit assignment challenge through its learned policy, thereby overcoming the limitations of conventional methods and proposing a novel framework for calibration of microscopic traffic simulations.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 10 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

Neural policies, however, tend to be over-parameterized and non-transparent, hindering their interpretability and deployability on resource-limited edge devices. This work presents SymLight, a priority function search framework based on Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for discovering inherently interpretable and deployable symbolic priority functions to serve as the TSC policies. The priority function, in particular, accepts traffic features as input and then outputs a priority for each traffic signal phase, which subsequently directs the phase transition. For effective search, we propose a concise yet expressive priority function representation. This helps mitigate the combinatorial explosion of the action space in MCTS. Additionally, a probabilistic structural rollout strategy is introduced to leverage structural patterns from previously discovered high-quality priority functions, guiding the rollout process. Our experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate SymLight's superior performance across a range of baselines. A key advantage is SymLight's ability to produce interpretable and deployable TSC policies while maintaining excellent performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[BLADE: Behavior-Level Anomaly Detection Using Network Traffic in Web Services](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05193v1)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With their widespread popularity, web services have become the main targets of various cyberattacks. Existing traffic anomaly detection approaches focus on flow-level attacks, yet fail to recognize behavior-level attacks, which appear benign in individual flows but reveal malicious purpose using multiple network flows. To transcend this limitation, we propose a novel unsupervised traffic anomaly detection system, BLADE, capable of detecting not only flow-level but also behavior-level attacks in web services. Our key observation is that application-layer operations of web services exhibit distinctive communication patterns at the network layer from a multi-flow perspective. BLADE first exploits a flow autoencoder to learn a latent feature representation and calculates its reconstruction losses per flow. Then, the latent representation is assigned a pseudo operation label using an unsupervised clustering method. Next, an anomaly score is computed based on the reconstruction losses. Finally, the triplets of timestamps, pseudo labels, and anomaly scores from multiple flows are aggregated and fed into a one-class classifier to characterize the behavior patterns of legitimate web operations, enabling the detection of flow-level and behavior-level anomalies. BLADE is extensively evaluated on both the custom dataset and the CIC-IDS2017 dataset. The experimental results demonstrate BLADE's superior performance, achieving high F1 scores of 0.9732 and 0.9801, respectively, on the two datasets, and outperforming traditional single-flow anomaly detection baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE MSN 2025</p></details> |
| **[Self-Interest and Systemic Benefits: Emergence of Collective Rationality in Mixed Autonomy Traffic Through Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04883v1)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are expected to be commercially available in the near future, leading to mixed autonomy traffic consisting of both AVs and human-driven vehicles (HVs). Although numerous studies have shown that AVs can be deployed to benefit the overall traffic system performance by incorporating system-level goals into their decision making, it is not clear whether the benefits still exist when agents act out of self-interest -- a trait common to all driving agents, both human and autonomous. This study aims to understand whether self-interested AVs can bring benefits to all driving agents in mixed autonomy traffic systems. The research is centered on the concept of collective rationality (CR). This concept, originating from game theory and behavioral economics, means that driving agents may cooperate collectively even when pursuing individual interests. Our recent research has proven the existence of CR in an analytical game-theoretical model and empirically in mixed human-driven traffic. In this paper, we demonstrate that CR can be attained among driving agents trained using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) with a simple reward design. We examine the extent to which self-interested traffic agents can achieve CR without directly incorporating system-level objectives. Results show that CR consistently emerges in various scenarios, which indicates the robustness of this property. We also postulate a mechanism to explain the emergence of CR in the microscopic and dynamic environment and verify it based on simulation evidence. This research suggests the possibility of leveraging advanced learning methods (such as federated learning) to achieve collective cooperation among self-interested driving agents in mixed-autonomy systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Smartphone User Fingerprinting on Wireless Traffic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03229v1)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to the openness of the wireless medium, smartphone users are susceptible to user privacy attacks, where user privacy information is inferred from encrypted Wi-Fi wireless traffic. Existing attacks are limited to recognizing mobile apps and their actions and cannot infer the smartphone user identity, a fundamental part of user privacy. To overcome this limitation, we propose U-Print, a novel attack system that can passively recognize smartphone apps, actions, and users from over-the-air MAC-layer frames. We observe that smartphone users usually prefer different add-on apps and in-app actions, yielding different changing patterns in Wi-Fi traffic. U-Print first extracts multi-level traffic features and exploits customized temporal convolutional networks to recognize smartphone apps and actions, thus producing users' behavior sequences. Then, it leverages the silhouette coefficient method to determine the number of users and applies the k-means clustering to profile and identify smartphone users. We implement U-Print using a laptop with a Kali dual-band wireless network card and evaluate it in three real-world environments. U-Print achieves an overall accuracy of 98.4% and an F1 score of 0.983 for user inference. Moreover, it can correctly recognize up to 96% of apps and actions in the closed world and more than 86% in the open world.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2408.07263</p></details> |
| **[Modeling Headway in Heterogeneous and Mixed Traffic Flow: A Statistical Distribution Based on a General Exponential Function](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03154v1)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ability of existing headway distributions to accurately reflect the diverse behaviors and characteristics in heterogeneous traffic (different types of vehicles) and mixed traffic (human-driven vehicles with autonomous vehicles) is limited, leading to unsatisfactory goodness of fit. To address these issues, we modified the exponential function to obtain a novel headway distribution. Rather than employing Euler's number (e) as the base of the exponential function, we utilized a real number base to provide greater flexibility in modeling the observed headway. However, the proposed is not a probability function. We normalize it to calculate the probability and derive the closed-form equation. In this study, we utilized a comprehensive experiment with five open datasets: highD, exiD, NGSIM, Waymo, and Lyft to evaluate the performance of the proposed distribution and compared its performance with six existing distributions under mixed and heterogeneous traffic flow. The results revealed that the proposed distribution not only captures the fundamental characteristics of headway distribution but also provides physically meaningful parameters that describe the distribution shape of observed headways. Under heterogeneous flow on highways (i.e., uninterrupted traffic flow), the proposed distribution outperforms other candidate distributions. Under urban road conditions (i.e., interrupted traffic flow), including heterogeneous and mixed traffic, the proposed distribution still achieves decent results.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Urban Vision Hackathon Dataset and Models: Towards Image Annotations and Accurate Vision Models for Indian Traffic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02563v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This report describes the UVH-26 dataset, the first public release by AIM@IISc of a large-scale dataset of annotated traffic-camera images from India. The dataset comprises 26,646 high-resolution (1080p) images sampled from 2800 Bengaluru's Safe-City CCTV cameras over a 4-week period, and subsequently annotated through a crowdsourced hackathon involving 565 college students from across India. In total, 1.8 million bounding boxes were labeled across 14 vehicle classes specific to India: Cycle, 2-Wheeler (Motorcycle), 3-Wheeler (Auto-rickshaw), LCV (Light Commercial Vehicles), Van, Tempo-traveller, Hatchback, Sedan, SUV, MUV, Mini-bus, Bus, Truck and Other. Of these, 283k-316k consensus ground truth bounding boxes and labels were derived for distinct objects in the 26k images using Majority Voting and STAPLE algorithms. Further, we train multiple contemporary detectors, including YOLO11-S/X, RT-DETR-S/X, and DAMO-YOLO-T/L using these datasets, and report accuracy based on mAP50, mAP75 and mAP50:95. Models trained on UVH-26 achieve 8.4-31.5% improvements in mAP50:95 over equivalent baseline models trained on COCO dataset, with RT-DETR-X showing the best performance at 0.67 (mAP50:95) as compared to 0.40 for COCO-trained weights for common classes (Car, Bus, and Truck). This demonstrates the benefits of domain-specific training data for Indian traffic scenarios. The release package provides the 26k images with consensus annotations based on Majority Voting (UVH-26-MV) and STAPLE (UVH-26-ST) and the 6 fine-tuned YOLO and DETR models on each of these datasets. By capturing the heterogeneity of Indian urban mobility directly from operational traffic-camera streams, UVH-26 addresses a critical gap in existing global benchmarks, and offers a foundation for advancing detection, classification, and deployment of intelligent transportation systems in emerging nations with complex traffic conditions.</p></details> |  |

However, such testing is limited by the scarcity of long-tailed, safety-critical scenarios in existing datasets collected in the real world. To tackle the data issue, we propose the Adv-BMT framework, which augments real-world scenarios with diverse and realistic adversarial traffic interactions. The core component of Adv-BMT is a bidirectional motion transformer (BMT) model to perform inverse traffic motion predictions, which takes agent information in the last time step of the scenario as input, and reconstructs the traffic in the inverse of chronological order until the initial time step. The Adv-BMT framework is a two-staged pipeline: it first conducts adversarial initializations and then inverse motion predictions. Different from previous work, we do not need any collision data for pretraining, and are able to generate realistic and diverse collision interactions. Our experimental results validate the quality of generated collision scenarios by Adv-BMT: training in our augmented dataset would reduce episode collision rates by 20%. Demo and code are available at: https://metadriverse.github.io/adv-bmt/.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Spatio-Temporal Online Robust Tensor Recovery Approach for Streaming Traffic Data Imputation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01267v1)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data quality is critical to Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), as complete and accurate traffic data underpin reliable decision-making in traffic control and management. Recent advances in low-rank tensor recovery algorithms have shown strong potential in capturing the inherent structure of high-dimensional traffic data and restoring degraded observations. However, traditional batch-based methods demand substantial computational and storage resources, which limits their scalability in the face of continuously expanding traffic data volumes. Moreover, recent online tensor recovery methods often suffer from severe performance degradation in complex real-world scenarios due to their insufficient exploitation of the intrinsic structural properties of traffic data. To address these challenges, we reformulate the traffic data recovery problem within a streaming framework, and propose a novel online robust tensor recovery algorithm that simultaneously leverages both the global spatio-temporal correlations and local consistency of traffic data, achieving high recovery accuracy and significantly improved computational efficiency in large-scale scenarios. Our method is capable of simultaneously handling missing and anomalous values in traffic data, and demonstrates strong adaptability across diverse missing patterns. Experimental results on three real-world traffic datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves high recovery accuracy while significantly improving computational efficiency by up to three orders of magnitude compared to state-of-the-art batch-based methods. These findings highlight the potential of the proposed approach as a scalable and effective solution for traffic data quality enhancement in ITS.</p></details> |  |
| **[Single-agent Reinforcement Learning Model for Regional Adaptive Traffic Signal Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00551v1)** | 2025-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Several studies have employed reinforcement learning (RL) to address the challenges of regional adaptive traffic signal control (ATSC) and achieved promising results. In this field, existing research predominantly adopts multi-agent frameworks. However, the adoption of multi-agent frameworks presents challenges for scalability. Instead, the Traffic signal control (TSC) problem necessitates a single-agent framework. TSC inherently relies on centralized management by a single control center, which can monitor traffic conditions across all roads in the study area and coordinate the control of all intersections. This work proposes a single-agent RL-based regional ATSC model compatible with probe vehicle technology. Key components of the RL design include state, action, and reward function definitions. To facilitate learning and manage congestion, both state and reward functions are defined based on queue length, with action designed to regulate queue dynamics. The queue length definition used in this study differs slightly from conventional definitions but is closely correlated with congestion states. More importantly, it allows for reliable estimation using link travel time data from probe vehicles. With probe vehicle data already covering most urban roads, this feature enhances the proposed method's potential for widespread deployment. The method was comprehensively evaluated using the SUMO simulation platform. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model effectively mitigates large-scale regional congestion levels via coordinated multi-intersection control.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust Single-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Regional Traffic Signal Control Under Demand Fluctuations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00549v1)** | 2025-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic congestion, primarily driven by intersection queuing, significantly impacts urban living standards, safety, environmental quality, and economic efficiency. While Traffic Signal Control (TSC) systems hold potential for congestion mitigation, traditional optimization models often fail to capture real-world traffic complexity and dynamics. This study introduces a novel single-agent reinforcement learning (RL) framework for regional adaptive TSC, circumventing the coordination complexities inherent in multi-agent systems through a centralized decision-making paradigm. The model employs an adjacency matrix to unify the encoding of road network topology, real-time queue states derived from probe vehicle data, and current signal timing parameters. Leveraging the efficient learning capabilities of the DreamerV3 world model, the agent learns control policies where actions sequentially select intersections and adjust their signal phase splits to regulate traffic inflow/outflow, analogous to a feedback control system. Reward design prioritizes queue dissipation, directly linking congestion metrics (queue length) to control actions. Simulation experiments conducted in SUMO demonstrate the model's effectiveness: under inference scenarios with multi-level (10%, 20%, 30%) Origin-Destination (OD) demand fluctuations, the framework exhibits robust anti-fluctuation capability and significantly reduces queue lengths. This work establishes a new paradigm for intelligent traffic control compatible with probe vehicle technology. Future research will focus on enhancing practical applicability by incorporating stochastic OD demand fluctuations during training and exploring regional optimization mechanisms for contingency events.</p></details> |  |
| **[Information-Theoretic Greedy Layer-wise Training for Traffic Sign Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27651v1)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern deep neural networks (DNNs) are typically trained with a global cross-entropy loss in a supervised end-to-end manner: neurons need to store their outgoing weights; training alternates between a forward pass (computation) and a top-down backward pass (learning) which is biologically implausible. Alternatively, greedy layer-wise training eliminates the need for cross-entropy loss and backpropagation. By avoiding the computation of intermediate gradients and the storage of intermediate outputs, it reduces memory usage and helps mitigate issues such as vanishing or exploding gradients. However, most existing layer-wise training approaches have been evaluated only on relatively small datasets with simple deep architectures. In this paper, we first systematically analyze the training dynamics of popular convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained by stochastic gradient descent (SGD) through an information-theoretic lens. Our findings reveal that networks converge layer-by-layer from bottom to top and that the flow of information adheres to a Markov information bottleneck principle. Building on these observations, we propose a novel layer-wise training approach based on the recently developed deterministic information bottleneck (DIB) and the matrix-based Rényi's $α$-order entropy functional. Specifically, each layer is trained jointly with an auxiliary classifier that connects directly to the output layer, enabling the learning of minimal sufficient task-relevant representations. We empirically validate the effectiveness of our training procedure on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 using modern deep CNNs and further demonstrate its applicability to a practical task involving traffic sign recognition. Our approach not only outperforms existing layer-wise training baselines but also achieves performance comparable to SGD.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Dual Large Language Models Architecture with Herald Guided Prompts for Parallel Fine Grained Traffic Signal Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00136v1)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Leveraging large language models (LLMs) in traffic signal control (TSC) improves optimization efficiency and interpretability compared to traditional reinforcement learning (RL) methods. However, existing LLM-based approaches are limited by fixed time signal durations and are prone to hallucination errors, while RL methods lack robustness in signal timing decisions and suffer from poor generalization. To address these challenges, this paper proposes HeraldLight, a dual LLMs architecture enhanced by Herald guided prompts. The Herald Module extracts contextual information and forecasts queue lengths for each traffic phase based on real-time conditions. The first LLM, LLM-Agent, uses these forecasts to make fine grained traffic signal control, while the second LLM, LLM-Critic, refines LLM-Agent's outputs, correcting errors and hallucinations. These refined outputs are used for score-based fine-tuning to improve accuracy and robustness. Simulation experiments using CityFlow on real world datasets covering 224 intersections in Jinan (12), Hangzhou (16), and New York (196) demonstrate that HeraldLight outperforms state of the art baselines, achieving a 20.03% reduction in average travel time across all scenarios and a 10.74% reduction in average queue length on the Jinan and Hangzhou scenarios.

Traditional batch learning models face challenges such as high maintenance and poor adaptability to rapid anomaly changes, known as concept drift. In contrast, streaming learning integrates online and incremental learning, enabling seamless updates and concept drift detection to improve robustness. This study investigates anomaly detection in streaming IoT traffic as binary classification, comparing batch and streaming learning approaches while assessing the limitations of current IoT traffic datasets. We simulated heterogeneous network data streams by carefully mixing existing datasets and streaming the samples one by one. Our results highlight the failure of batch models to handle concept drift, but also reveal persisting limitations of current datasets to expose model limitations due to low traffic heterogeneity. We also investigated the competitiveness of tree-based ML algorithms, well-known in batch anomaly detection, and compared it to non-tree-based ones, confirming the advantages of the former. Adaptive Random Forest achieved F1-score of 0.990 $\pm$ 0.006 at one-third the computational cost of its batch counterpart. Hoeffding Adaptive Tree reached F1-score of 0.910 $\pm$ 0.007, reducing computational cost by four times, making it a viable choice for online applications despite a slight trade-off in stability.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 11 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

Traditional accident prediction models treat road segments independently, failing to capture complex spatial relationships and temporal dependencies in urban transportation networks. This study develops MDAS-GNN, a Multi-Dimensional Attention-based Spatial-diffusion Graph Neural Network integrating three core risk dimensions: traffic safety, infrastructure, and environmental risk. The framework employs feature-specific spatial diffusion mechanisms and multi-head temporal attention to capture dependencies across different time horizons. Evaluated on UK Department for Transport accident data across Central London, South Manchester, and SE Birmingham, MDASGNN achieves superior performance compared to established baseline methods. The model maintains consistently low prediction errors across short, medium, and long-term periods, with particular strength in long-term forecasting. Ablation studies confirm that integrated multi-dimensional features outperform singlefeature approaches, reducing prediction errors by up to 40%. This framework provides civil engineers and urban planners with advanced predictive capabilities for transportation infrastructure design, enabling data-driven decisions for road network optimization, infrastructure resource improvements, and strategic safety interventions in urban development projects.</p></details> |  |

However, existing MLLMs in this domain primarily focus on coarse-grained image-level or video-level comprehension and often struggle to handle fine-grained visual details or localized scene components, limiting their applicability in complex accident scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose SafePLUG, a novel framework that empowers MLLMs with both Pixel-Level Understanding and temporal Grounding for comprehensive traffic accident analysis. SafePLUG supports both arbitrary-shaped visual prompts for region-aware question answering and pixel-level segmentation based on language instructions, while also enabling the recognition of temporally anchored events in traffic accident scenarios. To advance the development of MLLMs for traffic accident understanding, we curate a new dataset containing multimodal question-answer pairs centered on diverse accident scenarios, with detailed pixel-level annotations and temporal event boundaries. Experimental results show that SafePLUG achieves strong performance on multiple tasks, including region-based question answering, pixel-level segmentation, temporal event localization, and accident event understanding. These capabilities lay a foundation for fine-grained understanding of complex traffic scenes, with the potential to improve driving safety and enhance situational awareness in smart transportation systems.

| **[A Cloud-Based Spatio-Temporal GNN-Transformer Hybrid Model for Traffic Flow Forecasting with External Feature Integration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27039v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate traffic flow forecasting is essential for the development of intelligent transportation systems (ITS), supporting tasks such as traffic signal optimization, congestion management, and route planning. Traditional models often fail to effectively capture complex spatial-temporal dependencies in large-scale road networks, especially under the influence of external factors such as weather, holidays, and traffic accidents. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a cloud-based hybrid model that integrates Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (ST-GNN) with a Transformer architecture for traffic flow prediction. The model leverages the strengths of GNNs in modeling spatial correlations across road networks and the Transformers' ability to capture long-term temporal dependencies. External contextual features are incorporated via feature fusion to enhance predictive accuracy. The proposed model is deployed on a cloud computing platform to achieve scalability and real-time adaptability. Experimental evaluation of the dataset shows that our model outperforms baseline methods (LSTM, TCN, GCN, pure Transformer) with an RMSE of only 17.92 and a MAE of only 10.53. These findings suggest that the hybrid GNN-Transformer approach provides an effective and scalable solution for cloud-based ITS applications, offering methodological advancements for traffic flow forecasting and practical implications for congestion mitigation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Retrieval Augmented Generation-Enhanced Distributed LLM Agents for Generalizable Traffic Signal Control with Emergency Vehicles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26242v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With increasing urban traffic complexity, Traffic Signal Control (TSC) is essential for optimizing traffic flow and improving road safety. Large Language Models (LLMs) emerge as promising approaches for TSC. However, they are prone to hallucinations in emergencies, leading to unreliable decisions that may cause substantial delays for emergency vehicles. Moreover, diverse intersection types present substantial challenges for traffic state encoding and cross-intersection training, limiting generalization across heterogeneous intersections. Therefore, this paper proposes Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)-enhanced distributed LLM agents with Emergency response for Generalizable TSC (REG-TSC). Firstly, this paper presents an emergency-aware reasoning framework, which dynamically adjusts reasoning depth based on the emergency scenario and is equipped with a novel Reviewer-based Emergency RAG (RERAG) to distill specific knowledge and guidance from historical cases, enhancing the reliability and rationality of agents' emergency decisions. Secondly, this paper designs a type-agnostic traffic representation and proposes a Reward-guided Reinforced Refinement (R3) for heterogeneous intersections. R3 adaptively samples training experience from diverse intersections with environment feedback-based priority and fine-tunes LLM agents with a designed reward-weighted likelihood loss, guiding REG-TSC toward high-reward policies across heterogeneous intersections. On three real-world road networks with 17 to 177 heterogeneous intersections, extensive experiments show that REG-TSC reduces travel time by 42.00%, queue length by 62.31%, and emergency vehicle waiting time by 83.16%, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[DARTS: A Drone-Based AI-Powered Real-Time Traffic Incident Detection System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26004v1)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rapid and reliable incident detection is critical for reducing crash-related fatalities, injuries, and congestion. However, conventional methods, such as closed-circuit television, dashcam footage, and sensor-based detection, separate detection from verification, suffer from limited flexibility, and require dense infrastructure or high penetration rates, restricting adaptability and scalability to shifting incident hotspots. To overcome these challenges, we developed DARTS, a drone-based, AI-powered real-time traffic incident detection system. DARTS integrates drones' high mobility and aerial perspective for adaptive surveillance, thermal imaging for better low-visibility performance and privacy protection, and a lightweight deep learning framework for real-time vehicle trajectory extraction and incident detection. The system achieved 99% detection accuracy on a self-collected dataset and supports simultaneous online visual verification, severity assessment, and incident-induced congestion propagation monitoring via a web-based interface. In a field test on Interstate 75 in Florida, DARTS detected and verified a rear-end collision 12 minutes earlier than the local transportation management center and monitored incident-induced congestion propagation, suggesting potential to support faster emergency response and enable proactive traffic control to reduce congestion and secondary crash risk. Crucially, DARTS's flexible deployment architecture reduces dependence on frequent physical patrols, indicating potential scalability and cost-effectiveness for use in remote areas and resource-constrained settings. This study presents a promising step toward a more flexible and integrated real-time traffic incident detection system, with significant implications for the operational efficiency and responsiveness of modern transportation management.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint version.

| **[VISAT: Benchmarking Adversarial and Distribution Shift Robustness in Traffic Sign Recognition with Visual Attributes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26833v1)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present VISAT, a novel open dataset and benchmarking suite for evaluating model robustness in the task of traffic sign recognition with the presence of visual attributes. Built upon the Mapillary Traffic Sign Dataset (MTSD), our dataset introduces two benchmarks that respectively emphasize robustness against adversarial attacks and distribution shifts. For our adversarial attack benchmark, we employ the state-of-the-art Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) method to generate adversarial inputs and evaluate their impact on popular models. Additionally, we investigate the effect of adversarial attacks on attribute-specific multi-task learning (MTL) networks, revealing spurious correlations among MTL tasks. The MTL networks leverage visual attributes (color, shape, symbol, and text) that we have created for each traffic sign in our dataset. For our distribution shift benchmark, we utilize ImageNet-C's realistic data corruption and natural variation techniques to perform evaluations on the robustness of both base and MTL models. Moreover, we further explore spurious correlations among MTL tasks through synthetic alterations of traffic sign colors using color quantization techniques. Our experiments focus on two major backbones, ResNet-152 and ViT-B/32, and compare the performance between base and MTL models. The VISAT dataset and benchmarking framework contribute to the understanding of model robustness for traffic sign recognition, shedding light on the challenges posed by adversarial attacks and distribution shifts. We believe this work will facilitate advancements in developing more robust models for real-world applications in autonomous driving and cyber-physical systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adversarial Pre-Padding: Generating Evasive Network Traffic Against Transformer-Based Classifiers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25810v1)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To date, traffic obfuscation techniques have been widely adopted to protect network data privacy and security by obscuring the true patterns of traffic. Nevertheless, as the pre-trained models emerge, especially transformer-based classifiers, existing traffic obfuscation methods become increasingly vulnerable, as witnessed by current studies reporting the traffic classification accuracy up to 99\% or higher. To counter such high-performance transformer-based classification models, we in this paper propose a novel and effective \underline{adv}ersarial \underline{traffic}-generating approach (AdvTraffic\footnote{The code and data are available at: http://xxx}). Our approach has two key innovations: (i) a pre-padding strategy is proposed to modify packets, which effectively overcomes the limitations of existing research against transformer-based models for network traffic classification; and (ii) a reinforcement learning model is employed to optimize network traffic perturbations, aiming to maximize adversarial effectiveness against transformer-based classification models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to apply adversarial perturbation techniques to defend against transformer-based traffic classifiers. Furthermore, our method can be easily deployed into practical network environments. Finally, multi-faceted experiments are conducted across several real-world datasets, and the experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method can effectively undermine transformer-based classifiers, significantly reducing classification accuracy from 99\% to as low as 25.68\%.</p></details> |  |

Recent advances in time-series foundation models (TSFMs) have demonstrated strong zero-shot and few-shot generalization across diverse domains, yet their effectiveness for computer networking remains unexplored. This paper presents a systematic evaluation of a TSFM, IBM's Tiny Time Mixer (TTM), on the CESNET-TimeSeries24 dataset, a 40-week real-world ISP telemetry corpus. We assess TTM under zero-shot and few-shot settings across multiple forecasting horizons (hours to days), aggregation hierarchies (institutions, subnets, IPs), and temporal resolutions (10-minute and hourly). Results show that TTM achieves consistent accuracy (RMSE 0.026-0.057) and stable $R^2$ scores across horizons and context lengths, outperforming or matching fully trained deep learning baselines such as GRU and LSTM. Inference latency remains under 0.05s per 100 points on a single MacBook Pro using CPU-only computation, confirming deployability without dedicated GPU or MPS acceleration. These findings highlight the potential of pretrained TSFMs to enable scalable, efficient, and training-free forecasting for modern network monitoring and management systems.</p></details> |  |

Traffic was captured using Wireshark, and key metrics (including delay, jitter, bandwidth, and packet loss) were analyzed. Google Drive maintained the most consistent performance across both types of networks, showing low latency and reduced jitter. Dropbox showed efficient bandwidth utilization, but experienced a longer delay over LTE, attributed to a greater number of intermediate hops. OneDrive presented variable behavior, with elevated packet rates and increased sensitivity to fluctuations in the mobile network. A bimodal distribution of packet sizes was observed and modeled using a dual Poisson function. In general, Wi-Fi connections provided greater stability for multimedia transfers, while LTE performance varied depending on platform-specific implementations. The results contribute to a better understanding of traffic behavior in cloud-based storage applications and suggest further analysis with larger datasets and heterogeneous access networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>2025 ...</summary><p>2025 20th Iberian Conference on Information Systems and Technologies (CISTI), Lecture Notes in Networks and Systems</p></details> |

The dataset provides a unique view into global threat activity as observed through scanning and backscatter traffic, key indicators of large-scale probing behavior, data outages, and ongoing denial-of-service (DoS) campaigns. To process this extensive archive, coarse-to-fine methodology is adopted in which general insights are first extracted through a resource-efficient metadata sub-pipeline, followed by a more detailed packet header sub-pipeline for finer-grained analysis. The methodology establishes two sub-pipelines to enable scalable processing of nearly two decades of telescope data and supports multi-level exploration of traffic dynamics. Initial insights highlight long-term trends and recurring traffic spikes, some attributable to Internet-wide scanning events and others likely linked to DoS activities.We present general observations spanning 2006-2024, with a focused analysis of traffic characteristics during 2024.</p></details> |  |

We introduce CP-Bench, a minimal and fully controlled benchmark designed to isolate this capability using an extremely simple task: counting identical cubes in a synthetic scene while the camera moves and only reveals subsets of objects at any moment. Despite the simplicity of the setting, we find that state-of-the-art open-source and commercial models, including Qwen-3-VL, InternVL3, GPT-5, and Gemini-3-Pro, fail dramatically. A static-camera control variant confirms that the failure arises not from object recognition but from an inability to accumulate evidence across time. Further experiments show that neither higher sampling FPS, perception- or spatial-enhanced models, nor finetuning with additional videos leads to meaningful cross-temporal generalization. Our results reveal a fundamental limitation in modern multimodal architectures and training paradigms. CP-Bench provides a simple yet powerful diagnostic tool and establishes a clean testbed for developing models capable of genuine time-consistent visual reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Predicting Onsets and Dry Spells of the West African Monsoon Season Using Machine Learning Methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01965v1)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The beginning of the rainy season and the occurrence of dry spells in West Africa is notoriously difficult to predict, however these are the key indicators farmers use to decide when to plant crops, having a major influence on their overall yield. While many studies have shown correlations between global sea surface temperatures and characteristics of the West African monsoon season, there are few that effectively implementing this information into machine learning (ML) prediction models. In this study we investigated the best ways to define our target variables, onset and dry spell, and produced methods to predict them for upcoming seasons using sea surface temperature teleconnections. Defining our target variables required the use of a combination of two well known definitions of onset. We then applied custom statistical techniques -- like total variation regularization and predictor selection -- to the two models we constructed, the first being a linear model and the other an adaptive-threshold logistic regression model. We found mixed results for onset prediction, with spatial verification showing signs of significant skill, while temporal verification showed little to none. For dry spell though, we found significant accuracy through the analysis of multiple binary classification metrics. These models overcome some limitations that current approaches have, such as being computationally intensive and needing bias correction. We also introduce this study as a framework to use ML methods for targeted prediction of certain weather phenomenon using climatologically relevant variables. As we apply ML techniques to more problems, we see clear benefits for fields like meteorology and lay out a few new directions for further research.</p></details> |  |
| **[GrndCtrl: Grounding World Models via Self-Supervised Reward Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01952v1)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in video world modeling have enabled large-scale generative models to simulate embodied environments with high visual fidelity, providing strong priors for prediction, planning, and control. Yet, despite their realism, these models often lack geometric grounding, limiting their use in navigation tasks that require spatial coherence and long-horizon stability. We introduce Reinforcement Learning with World Grounding (RLWG), a self-supervised post-training framework that aligns pretrained world models with a physically verifiable structure through geometric and perceptual rewards. Analogous to reinforcement learning from verifiable feedback (RLVR) in language models, RLWG can use multiple rewards that measure pose cycle-consistency, depth reprojection, and temporal coherence. We instantiate this framework with GrndCtrl, a reward-aligned adaptation method based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), yielding world models that maintain stable trajectories, consistent geometry, and reliable rollouts for embodied navigation. Like post-training alignment in large language models, GrndCtrl leverages verifiable rewards to bridge generative pretraining and grounded behavior, achieving superior spatial coherence and navigation stability over supervised fine-tuning in outdoor environments.</p></details> |  |

While SAM2 excels in video object segmentation by providing dense segmentation masks based on prompts, extending it to dense Video Semantic Segmentation (VSS) poses challenges due to the need for spatial accuracy, temporal consistency, and the ability to track multiple objects with complex boundaries and varying scales. This paper explores the extension of SAM2 for VSS, focusing on two primary approaches and highlighting firsthand observations and common challenges faced during this process. The first approach involves using SAM2 to extract unique objects as masks from a given image, with a segmentation network employed in parallel to generate and refine initial predictions. The second approach utilizes the predicted masks to extract unique feature vectors, which are then fed into a simple network for classification. The resulting classifications and masks are subsequently combined to produce the final segmentation. Our experiments suggest that leveraging SAM2 enhances overall performance in VSS, primarily due to its precise predictions of object boundaries.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 3 figures and 7 tables</p></details> |

Accurate predictive models require high-resolution spatio-temporal data to capture complex dynamics of environmental and human factors. To address the scarcity of fine-grained wildfire datasets in Spain, we introduce IberFire: a spatio-temporal dataset with 1 km x 1 km x 1-day resolution, covering mainland Spain and the Balearic Islands from December 2007 to December 2024. IberFire integrates 120 features across eight categories: auxiliary data, fire history, geography, topography, meteorology, vegetation indices, human activity and land cover. All features and processing rely on open-access data and tools, with a publicly available codebase ensuring transparency and applicability. IberFire offers enhanced spatial granularity and feature diversity compared to existing European datasets, and provides a reproducible framework. It supports advanced wildfire risk modelling via Machine Learning and Deep Learning, facilitates climate trend analysis, and informs fire prevention and land management strategies.

The lack of large-scale annotated datasets and the limitations of current synthetic pipelines, particularly in modeling temporal degradations, further hinder progress. Moreover, existing VIS methods are not robust to the degradations found in low-light videos and, as a result, perform poorly even when finetuned on low-light data. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{ELVIS} (\textbf{E}nhance \textbf{L}ow-light for \textbf{V}ideo \textbf{I}nstance \textbf{S}egmentation), a novel framework that enables effective domain adaptation of state-of-the-art VIS models to low-light scenarios. ELVIS comprises an unsupervised synthetic low-light video pipeline that models both spatial and temporal degradations, a calibration-free degradation profile synthesis network (VDP-Net) and an enhancement decoder head that disentangles degradations from content features. ELVIS improves performances by up to \textbf{+3.7AP} on the synthetic low-light YouTube-VIS 2019 dataset. Code will be released upon acceptance.</p></details> |  |

However, existing 4D reconstruction methods face challenges in generating high-quality topology-consistent meshes. To address this, we propose a topology-aware dynamic reconstruction framework based on Gaussian Splatting. We introduce a Gaussian topological structure that explicitly encodes spatial connectivity. This structure enables topology-aware densification and pruning, preserving the manifold consistency of the Gaussian representation. Temporal regularization terms further ensure topological coherence over time, while differentiable mesh rasterization improves mesh quality. Experimental results demonstrate that our method reconstructs topology-consistent mesh sequences with significantly higher accuracy than existing approaches. Moreover, the resulting meshes enable precise 3D keypoint tracking. Project page: https://haza628.github.io/tagSplat/</p></details> |  |

In contrast with the state-of-the-art method of CASA, where sequences of 3D skeleton coordinates are taken directly as input, our key idea is to use sequences of 2D skeleton heatmaps as input. Unlike CASA which performs self-attention in the temporal domain only, we feed 2D skeleton heatmaps to a video transformer which performs self-attention both in the spatial and temporal domains for extracting effective spatiotemporal and contextual features. In addition, we introduce simple heatmap augmentation techniques based on 2D skeletons for self-supervised learning. Despite the lack of 3D information, our approach achieves not only higher accuracy but also better robustness against missing and noisy keypoints than CASA. Furthermore, extensive evaluations on three public datasets, i.e., Penn Action, IKEA ASM, and H2O, demonstrate that our approach outperforms previous methods in different fine-grained human activity understanding tasks. Finally, fusing 2D skeleton heatmaps with RGB videos yields the state-of-the-art on all metrics and datasets. To our best knowledge, our work is the first to utilize 2D skeleton heatmap inputs and the first to explore multi-modality fusion for temporal video alignment.

| **[The Dynamical Model Representation of Convolution-Generated Spatio-Temporal Gaussian Processes and Its Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01279v1)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Convolution-generated space-time models yield an important class of non-separable stationary Gaussian Processes (GP) through a sequence of convolution operations, in both space and time, on spatially correlated Brownian motion with a Gaussian convolution kernel. Because of its solid connection to stochastic partial differential equations, such a modeling approach offers strong physical interpretations when it is applied to scientific and engineering processes. In this paper, we obtain a new dynamical model representation for convolution-generated spatio-temporal GP. In particular, an infinite-dimensional linear state-space representation is firstly obtained where the state transition is governed by a stochastic differential equation (SDE) whose solution has the same space-time covariance as the original convolution-generated process. Then, using the Galerkin's method, a finite-dimension approximation to the infinite-dimensional SDE is obtained, yielding a dynamical model with finite states that facilitates the computation and parameter estimation. The space-time covariance of the approximated dynamical model is obtained, and the error between the approximate and exact covariance matrices is quantified. We investigate the performance of the proposed model through a simulation-based study, and apply the approach to a real case study utilizing the remote-sensing aerosol data during the recent 2025 Los Angeles wildfire. The modeling capability of the proposed approach has been well demonstrated, and the proposed approach is found particularly effective in monitoring the first-order time derivative of the underlying space-time process, making it a good candidate for process modeling, monitoring and anomaly detection problems. Computer code and data have been made publicly available.</p></details> |  |

To support development and evaluation, we introduce CPREval-6k, a multi-view, multi-label medical action benchmark containing 6,372 expert-annotated videos with 22 clinical labels. Using this dataset, we present GaussMedAct, a multivariate Gaussian encoding framework, to advance medical motion analysis through adaptive spatiotemporal representation learning. Multivariate Gaussian Representation projects the joint motions to a temporally scaled multi-dimensional space, and decomposes actions into adaptive 3D Gaussians that serve as tokens. These tokens preserve motion semantics through anisotropic covariance modeling while maintaining robustness to spatiotemporal noise. Hybrid Spatial Encoding, employing a Cartesian and Vector dual-stream strategy, effectively utilizes skeletal information in the form of joint and bone features. The proposed method achieves 92.1% Top-1 accuracy with real-time inference on the benchmark, outperforming baseline by +5.9% accuracy with only 10% FLOPs. Cross-dataset experiments confirm the superiority of our method in robustness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2026</p></details> |

However, the interpretability and coherence of the decision process and the plausibility of action sequences remain largely underexplored. To address these issues, we propose AutoDrive-R$^2$, a novel VLA framework that enhances both reasoning and self-reflection capabilities of autonomous driving systems through chain-of-thought (CoT) processing and reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, we first propose an innovative CoT dataset named nuScenesR$^2$-6K for supervised fine-tuning, which effectively builds cognitive bridges between input information and output trajectories through a four-step logical chain with self-reflection for validation. Moreover, to maximize both reasoning and self-reflection during the RL stage, we further employ the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm within a physics-grounded reward framework that incorporates spatial alignment, vehicle dynamic, and temporal smoothness criteria to ensure reliable and realistic trajectory planning. Extensive evaluation results across both nuScenes and Waymo datasets demonstrates the state-of-the-art performance and robust generalization capacity of our proposed method.</p></details> |  |

Current approaches typically employ task-specific models with independent architectures, leading to computational redundancy and ignoring potential correlations across related tasks. We introduce OmniFD, a unified framework that jointly addresses four core face forgery detection tasks within a single model, i.e., image and video classification, spatial localization, and temporal localization. Our architecture consists of three principal components: (1) a shared Swin Transformer encoder that extracts unified 4D spatiotemporal representations from both images and video inputs, (2) a cross-task interaction module with learnable queries that dynamically captures inter-task dependencies through attention-based reasoning, and (3) lightweight decoding heads that transform refined representations into corresponding predictions for all FFD tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate OmniFD's advantage over task-specific models. Its unified design leverages multi-task learning to capture generalized representations across tasks, especially enabling fine-grained knowledge transfer that facilitates other tasks.

Static partitioning of model layers presumes temporal stability across compute and network resources, which is misaligned with the volatility of real-world deployments. We introduce a framework in which both the spatial placement and internal segmentation of foundation models are elevated to runtime-resolved constructs. The orchestration problem is formalized as a constrained optimization over layer-wise assignments, subject to evolving latency, utilization, and privacy gradients. The framework implements reactive inference composition responsive to infrastructural fluctuations by integrating model-aware capacity profiling with dynamic graph re-partitioning and reallocation. We introduce architectural and algorithmic components, along with a representative use case in 6G multi-access edge computing.</p></details> |  |

However, fully utilizing the multi-domain characteristics of EEG signals remains a significant challenge. Traditional single-perspective analyses often fail to capture the complex interplay of temporal, frequency, and spatial dimensions in EEG data. To address this, we introduce a multi-view graph transformer (MVGT) based on spatial relations that integrates information across three domains: temporal dynamics from continuous series, frequency features extracted from frequency bands, and inter-channel relationships captured through several spatial encodings. This comprehensive approach allows model to capture the nuanced properties inherent in EEG signals, enhancing its flexibility and representational power. Evaluation on publicly available datasets demonstrates that MVGT surpasses state-of-the-art methods in performance. The results highlight its ability to extract multi-domain information and effectively model inter-channel relationships, showcasing its potential for EEG-based emotion recognition tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICONIP 2025 (Oral). 16 pages, 5 figures</p></details> |

Most existing video understanding benchmarks focus on single-video analysis, failing to assess the ability of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to simultaneously reason over various videos. Recent benchmarks evaluate MLLMs' capabilities on multi-view videos that capture different perspectives of the same scene. However, their limited tasks hinder a thorough assessment of MLLMs in diverse real-world CVR scenarios. To this end, we introduce CrossVid, the first benchmark designed to comprehensively evaluate MLLMs' spatial-temporal reasoning ability in cross-video contexts. Firstly, CrossVid encompasses a wide spectrum of hierarchical tasks, comprising four high-level dimensions and ten specific tasks, thereby closely reflecting the complex and varied nature of real-world video understanding. Secondly, CrossVid provides 5,331 videos, along with 9,015 challenging question-answering pairs, spanning single-choice, multiple-choice, and open-ended question formats. Through extensive experiments on various open-source and closed-source MLLMs, we observe that Gemini-2.5-Pro performs best on CrossVid, achieving an average accuracy of 50.4%. Notably, our in-depth case study demonstrates that most current MLLMs struggle with CVR tasks, primarily due to their inability to integrate or compare evidence distributed across multiple videos for reasoning. These insights highlight the potential of CrossVid to guide future advancements in enhancing MLLMs' CVR capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2026 (main track).

In streaming video scenarios, the primary bottleneck lies in the Vision Transformer (ViT) encoding stage, where redundant processing of temporally similar frames leads to inefficiency. Additionally, inflated token sequences during LLM pre-filling further exacerbate latency and memory overhead. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{S}treaming \textbf{T}oken \textbf{C}ompression (\textbf{STC}), a plug-and-play hierarchical framework that seamlessly integrates into existing streaming VideoLLMs, optimizing both ViT encoding and LLM pre-filling stages to accelerate processing. STC introduces two token-level accelerators: \textbf{STC-Cacher}, which reduces ViT encoding overhead by caching and reusing features from temporally similar frames, and \textbf{STC-Pruner}, which compresses the visual token sequence before it enters the LLM, preserving only the most salient tokens based on both spatial and temporal relevance. Extensive experiments on four baseline streaming VideoLLMs across five benchmarks demonstrate that STC outperforms other compression methods. Notably, STC retains up to \textbf{99\%} of accuracy on the ReKV framework while reducing ViT encoding latency and LLM pre-filling latency by \textbf{24.5\%} and \textbf{45.3\%}.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code is avaliable at \url{https://github.com/lern-to-write/STC}</p></details> |

However, existing semantic HOI benchmarks focused either on manipulation or on the resulting effects at a coarse level, lacking fine-grained spatio-temporal reasoning to capture the underlying dynamics in HOI. We introduce HanDyVQA, a fine-grained video question-answering benchmark that comprehensively covers both the manipulation and effect aspects of HOI. HanDyVQA comprises six complementary question types (Action, Process, Objects, Location, State Change, and Object Parts), totalling 11.1K multiple-choice QA pairs. Collected QA pairs recognizing manipulation styles, hand/object motions, and part-level state changes. HanDyVQA also includes 10.3K segmentation masks for Objects and Object Parts questions, enabling the evaluation of object/part-level reasoning in video object segmentation. We evaluated recent video foundation models on our benchmark and found that even the best-performing model, Gemini-2.5-Pro, reached only 73% average accuracy, which is far from human performance (97%). Further analysis shows the remaining challenges in spatial relationship, motion, and part-level geometric understanding. We also found that integrating explicit HOI-related cues into visual features improves performance, offering insights for developing future models with a deeper understanding of HOI dynamics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://masatate.github.io/HanDyVQA-project-page/</p></details> |

While existing approaches have primarily focused on visual observations, real-world perception inherently involves multiple sensory modalities. Audio provides crucial spatial and temporal cues such as sound source localization and acoustic scene properties, yet its integration into world models remains largely unexplored. No prior work has formally defined what constitutes an audio-visual world model or how to jointly capture binaural spatial audio and visual dynamics under precise action control with task reward prediction. This work presents the first formal framework for Audio-Visual World Models (AVWM), formulating multimodal environment simulation as a partially observable Markov decision process with synchronized audio-visual observations, fine-grained actions, and task rewards. To address the lack of suitable training data, we construct AVW-4k, a dataset comprising 30 hours of binaural audio-visual trajectories with action annotations and reward signals across 76 indoor environments. We propose AV-CDiT, an Audio-Visual Conditional Diffusion Transformer with a novel modality expert architecture that balances visual and auditory learning, optimized through a three-stage training strategy for effective multimodal integration. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AV-CDiT achieves high-fidelity multimodal prediction across visual and auditory modalities with reward. Furthermore, we validate its practical utility in continuous audio-visual navigation tasks, where AVWM significantly enhances the agent's performance.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we present GigaWorld-0, a unified world model framework designed explicitly as a data engine for Vision-Language-Action (VLA) learning. GigaWorld-0 integrates two synergistic components: GigaWorld-0-Video, which leverages large-scale video generation to produce diverse, texture-rich, and temporally coherent embodied sequences under fine-grained control of appearance, camera viewpoint, and action semantics; and GigaWorld-0-3D, which combines 3D generative modeling, 3D Gaussian Splatting reconstruction, physically differentiable system identification, and executable motion planning to ensure geometric consistency and physical realism. Their joint optimization enables the scalable synthesis of embodied interaction data that is visually compelling, spatially coherent, physically plausible, and instruction-aligned. Training at scale is made feasible through our efficient GigaTrain framework, which exploits FP8-precision and sparse attention to drastically reduce memory and compute requirements. We conduct comprehensive evaluations showing that GigaWorld-0 generates high-quality, diverse, and controllable data across multiple dimensions. Critically, VLA model (e.g., GigaBrain-0) trained on GigaWorld-0-generated data achieve strong real-world performance, significantly improving generalization and task success on physical robots without any real-world interaction during training.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://giga-world-0.github.io/</p></details> |

We present Med-CMR, a fine-grained Medical Complex Multimodal Reasoning benchmark. Med-CMR distinguishes from existing counterparts by three core features: 1) Systematic capability decomposition, splitting medical multimodal reasoning into fine-grained visual understanding and multi-step reasoning to enable targeted evaluation; 2) Challenging task design, with visual understanding across three key dimensions (small-object detection, fine-detail discrimination, spatial understanding) and reasoning covering four clinically relevant scenarios (temporal prediction, causal reasoning, long-tail generalization, multi-source integration); 3) Broad, high-quality data coverage, comprising 20,653 Visual Question Answering (VQA) pairs spanning 11 organ systems and 12 imaging modalities, validated via a rigorous two-stage (human expert + model-assisted) review to ensure clinical authenticity. We evaluate 18 state-of-the-art MLLMs with Med-CMR, revealing GPT-5 as the top-performing commercial model: 57.81 accuracy on multiple-choice questions (MCQs) and a 48.70 open-ended score, outperforming Gemini 2.5 Pro (49.87 MCQ accuracy, 45.98 open-ended score) and leading open-source model Qwen3-VL-235B-A22B (49.34 MCQ accuracy, 42.62 open-ended score). However, specialized medical MLLMs do not reliably outperform strong general models, and long-tail generalization emerges as the dominant failure mode. Med-CMR thus provides a stress test for visual-reasoning integration and rare-case robustness in medical MLLMs, and a rigorous yardstick for future clinical systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluating Spatio-Temporal Forecasting Trade-offs Between Graph Neural Networks and Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05179v2)** | 2025-11-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern IoT deployments for environmental sensing produce high volume spatiotemporal data to support downstream tasks such as forecasting, typically powered by machine learning models. While existing filtering and strategic deployment techniques optimize collected data volume at the edge, they overlook how variations in sampling frequencies and spatial coverage affect downstream model performance. In many forecasting models, incorporating data from additional sensors denoise predictions by providing broader spatial contexts. This interplay between sampling frequency, spatial coverage and different forecasting model architectures remain underexplored. This work presents a systematic study of forecasting models - classical models (VAR), neural networks (GRU, Transformer), spatio-temporal graph neural networks (STGNNs), and time series foundation models (TSFMs: Chronos Moirai, TimesFM) under varying spatial sensor nodes density and sampling intervals using real-world temperature data in a wireless sensor network. Our results show that STGNNs are effective when sensor deployments are sparse and sampling rate is moderate, leveraging spatial correlations via encoded graph structure to compensate for limited coverage. In contrast, TSFMs perform competitively at high frequencies but degrade when spatial coverage from neighboring sensors is reduced. Crucially, the multivariate TSFM Moirai outperforms all models by natively learning cross-sensor dependencies. These findings offer actionable insights for building efficient forecasting pipelines in spatio-temporal systems.

Recent advancements in artificial intelligence, particularly deep learning, have enabled transformative progress in medical imaging analysis. Deep learning-based computer vision models, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), transformers, and hybrid attention architectures, can automatically extract complex spatial, morphological, and temporal patterns from multimodal imaging data including MRI, CT, PET, mammography, histopathology, and ultrasound. These models surpass traditional radiological assessment by identifying subtle tissue abnormalities and tumor microenvironment variations invisible to the human eye. At a broader scale, the integration of multimodal imaging with radiogenomics linking quantitative imaging features with genomics, transcriptomics, and epigenetic biomarkers has introduced a new paradigm for personalized oncology. This radiogenomic fusion allows the prediction of tumor genotype, immune response, molecular subtypes, and treatment resistance without invasive biopsies.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Cross-Hierarchical Difference Feature Fusion Network Based on Multiscale Encoder-Decoder for Hyperspectral Change Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16988v2)** | 2025-11-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hyperspectral change detection (HCD) is one of the core applications of remote sensing images, holding significant research value in fields like environmental monitoring and disaster assessment. However, existing methods often suffer from incomplete capture of multiscale spatial-spectral features and insufficient fusion of differential feature information. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a Cross-Hierarchical Differential Feature Fusion Network (CHDFFN) based on a multiscale encoder-decoder. Firstly, a multiscale feature extraction subnetwork is designed, taking the customized encoder-decoder as the backbone, combined with residual connections and the proposed dual-core channel-spatial attention module to achieve multi-level extraction and initial integration of spatial-spectral features. The encoder embeds convolutional blocks with different receptive field sizes to capture multiscale representations from shallow details to deep semantics. The decoder fuses the encoder's output via skip connections to gradually restore spatial resolution while suppressing background noise and redundancy. To enhance the model's ability to capture differential features between bi-temporal hyperspectral images, a spatial-spectral change feature learning module is designed to learn hierarchical change representations. Additionally, an adaptive high-level feature fusion module is proposed, dynamically balancing the contribution of hierarchical differential features by adaptively assigning weights, which effectively strengthens the model's capability to characterize complex change patterns. Finally, experiments on four public hyperspectral datasets show that compared with some state-of-the-art methods, the average maximum improvements of OA, KC, and F1 are 4.61%, 19.79%, and 18.90% respectively, verifying the model's effectiveness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Describe Anything Anywhere At Any Moment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00565v1)** | 2025-11-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computer vision and robotics applications ranging from augmented reality to robot autonomy in large-scale environments require spatio-temporal memory frameworks that capture both geometric structure for accurate language-grounding as well as semantic detail. Existing methods face a tradeoff, where producing rich open-vocabulary descriptions comes at the expense of real-time performance when these descriptions have to be grounded in 3D. To address these challenges, we propose Describe Anything, Anywhere, at Any Moment (DAAAM), a novel spatio-temporal memory framework for large-scale and real-time 4D scene understanding. DAAAM introduces a novel optimization-based frontend to infer detailed semantic descriptions from localized captioning models, such as the Describe Anything Model (DAM), leveraging batch processing to speed up inference by an order of magnitude for online processing. It leverages such semantic understanding to build a hierarchical 4D scene graph (SG), which acts as an effective globally spatially and temporally consistent memory representation. DAAAM constructs 4D SGs with detailed, geometrically grounded descriptions while maintaining real-time performance. We show that DAAAM's 4D SG interfaces well with a tool-calling agent for inference and reasoning. We thoroughly evaluate DAAAM in the complex task of spatio-temporal question answering on the NaVQA benchmark and show its generalization capabilities for sequential task grounding on the SG3D benchmark. We further curate an extended OC-NaVQA benchmark for large-scale and long-time evaluations. DAAAM achieves state-of-the-art results in both tasks, improving OC-NaVQA question accuracy by 53.6%, position errors by 21.9%, temporal errors by 21.6%, and SG3D task grounding accuracy by 27.8% over the most competitive baselines, respectively.

Updating 3D scenes from sparse-view observations is crucial for various real-world applications, including urban planning, disaster assessment, and historical site preservation, where dense scans are often unavailable or impractical. In this paper, we propose Cross-Temporal 3D Gaussian Splatting (Cross-Temporal 3DGS), a novel framework for efficiently reconstructing and updating 3D scenes across different time periods, using sparse images and previously captured scene priors. Our approach comprises three stages: 1) Cross-temporal camera alignment for estimating and aligning camera poses across different timestamps; 2) Interference-based confidence initialization to identify unchanged regions between timestamps, thereby guiding updates; and 3) Progressive cross-temporal optimization, which iteratively integrates historical prior information into the 3D scene to enhance reconstruction quality. Our method supports non-continuous capture, enabling not only updates using new sparse views to refine existing scenes, but also recovering past scenes from limited data with the help of current captures. Furthermore, we demonstrate the potential of this approach to achieve temporal changes using only sparse images, which can later be reconstructed into detailed 3D representations as needed. Experimental results show significant improvements over baseline methods in reconstruction quality and data efficiency, making this approach a promising solution for scene versioning, cross-temporal digital twins, and long-term spatial documentation.</p></details> | AAAI2026 accepted |
| **[HyCoVAD: A Hybrid SSL-LLM Model for Complex Video Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22544v3)** | 2025-11-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection (VAD) is crucial for intelligent surveillance, but a significant challenge lies in identifying complex anomalies, which are events defined by intricate relationships and temporal dependencies among multiple entities rather than by isolated actions. While self-supervised learning (SSL) methods effectively model low-level spatiotemporal patterns, they often struggle to grasp the semantic meaning of these interactions. Conversely, large language models (LLMs) offer powerful contextual reasoning but are computationally expensive for frame-by-frame analysis and lack fine-grained spatial localization. We introduce HyCoVAD, Hybrid Complex Video Anomaly Detection, a hybrid SSL-LLM model that combines a multi-task SSL temporal analyzer with LLM validator. The SSL module is built upon an nnFormer backbone which is a transformer-based model for image segmentation. It is trained with multiple proxy tasks, learns from video frames to identify those suspected of anomaly. The selected frames are then forwarded to the LLM, which enriches the analysis with semantic context by applying structured, rule-based reasoning to validate the presence of anomalies. Experiments on the challenging ComplexVAD dataset show that HyCoVAD achieves a 72.5% frame-level AUC, outperforming existing baselines by 12.5% while reducing LLM computation. We release our interaction anomaly taxonomy, adaptive thresholding protocol, and code to facilitate future research in complex VAD scenarios.</p></details> | 25 pages, 1 figure |

However, many existing HMP methods either produce a single, deterministic forecast that ignores uncertainty or rely on probabilistic models that sacrifice kinematic plausibility. Diffusion models improve the accuracy-diversity trade-off but often depend on multi-stage pipelines that are costly for edge deployment. This work focuses on how to ensure spatial-temporal coherence within a single-stage diffusion model for HMP. We introduce SMamDiff, a Spatial Mamba-based Diffusion model with two novel designs: (i) a residual-DCT motion encoding that subtracts the last observed pose before a temporal DCT, reducing the first DC component ($f=0$) dominance and highlighting informative higher-frequency cues so the model learns how joints move rather than where they are; and (ii) a stickman-drawing spatial-mamba module that processes joints in an ordered, joint-by-joint manner, making later joints condition on earlier ones to induce long-range, cross-joint dependencies. On Human3.6M and HumanEva, these coherence mechanisms deliver state-of-the-art results among single-stage probabilistic HMP methods while using less latency and memory than multi-stage diffusion baselines.</p></details> |  |

Most existing Gaussian-based methods rely on random initialization of many primitives within predefined spatial bounds, resulting in redundancy and poor scalability to unbounded scenes. Recent depth-guided approach alleviates this issue but remains local, suffering from latency and memory overhead as scale increases. To overcome these challenges, we propose TGSFormer, a scalable Temporal Gaussian Splatting framework for embodied SSC. It maintains a persistent Gaussian memory for temporal prediction, without relying on image coherence or frame caches. For temporal fusion, a Dual Temporal Encoder jointly processes current and historical Gaussian features through confidence-aware cross-attention. Subsequently, a Confidence-aware Voxel Fusion module merges overlapping primitives into voxel-aligned representations, regulating density and maintaining compactness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TGSFormer achieves state-of-the-art results on both local and embodied SSC benchmarks, offering superior accuracy and scalability with significantly fewer primitives while maintaining consistent long-term scene integrity. The code will be released upon acceptance.</p></details> | 14 pages, 10 figures |

Recently, transformer models have shown remarkable potential in weather forecasting achieving state-of-the-art results. However, traditional transformers discretize spatio-temporal dimensions, limiting their ability to model continuous dynamical weather processes. Moreover, their reliance on increased depth to capture complex dependencies results in higher computational cost and parameter redundancy. We address these issues with STC-ViT, a Spatio-Temporal Continuous Vision Transformer for weather forecasting. STC-ViT integrates a Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) for global spatial operators with a transformer parameterised Neural ODE for continuous-time dynamics, yielding a space-time continuous model for weather forecasting. Our proposed method achieves competitive forecasting performance even with a shallow, single-layer transformer encoder mitigating the reliance on deeper networks. STC-ViT generates complete forecast trajectories with an inference speed of only 0.125 seconds and achieves strong medium-range forecasting skill on 1.5-degree WeatherBench 2 as compared to state-of-the-art data-driven and NWP models trained on higher-resolution data, with substantially lower data and compute costs. We also provide detailed empirical analysis on model's performance with respect to denser time grids, higher-accuracy ODE solvers, and deeper transformer stacks.</p></details> |  |

We formalize audio 4D intelligence that is defined as reasoning over sound dynamics in time and 3D space, and introduce STAR-Bench to measure it. STAR-Bench combines a Foundational Acoustic Perception setting (six attributes under absolute and relative regimes) with a Holistic Spatio-Temporal Reasoning setting that includes segment reordering for continuous and discrete processes and spatial tasks spanning static localization, multi-source relations, and dynamic trajectories. Our data curation pipeline uses two methods to ensure high-quality samples. For foundational tasks, we use procedurally synthesized and physics-simulated audio. For holistic data, we follow a four-stage process that includes human annotation and final selection based on human performance. Unlike prior benchmarks where caption-only answering reduces accuracy slightly, STAR-Bench induces far larger drops (-31.5\% temporal, -35.2\% spatial), evidencing its focus on linguistically hard-to-describe cues. Evaluating 19 models reveals substantial gaps compared with humans and a capability hierarchy: closed-source models are bottlenecked by fine-grained perception, while open-source models lag across perception, knowledge, and reasoning. Our STAR-Bench provides critical insights and a clear path forward for developing future models with a more robust understanding of the physical world.</p></details> | <details><summary>Homep...</summary><p>Homepage: https://internlm.github.io/StarBench/</p></details> |

Despite they provide a geometrically consistent way of treating complex domains, applying such architectures to parameterized dynamical systems for temporal prediction beyond the training data, i.e. the extrapolation regime, is still a challenging task due to the simultaneous need of temporal causality and generalizability in the parametric space. In this work, we explore the integration of graph convolutional autoencoders (GCAs) with tensor train (TT) decomposition and Operator Inference (OpInf) to develop a time-consistent reduced-order model. In particular, high-fidelity snapshots are represented as a combination of parametric, spatial, and temporal cores via TT decomposition, while OpInf is used to learn the evolution of the latter. Moreover, we enhance the generalization performance by developing a multi-fidelity two-stages approach in the framework of Deep Operator Networks (DeepONet), treating the spatial and temporal cores as the trunk networks, and the parametric core as the branch network. Numerical results, including heat-conduction, advection-diffusion and vortex-shedding phenomena, demonstrate great performance in effectively learning the dynamic in the extrapolation regime for complex geometries, also in comparison with state-of-the-art approaches e.g. MeshGraphNets.</p></details> |  |

We introduce SolarCHIP, a family of contrastively pretrained visual backbones tailored to multi-instrument SDO observations. SolarCHIP addresses three key challenges in solar imaging: multimodal sensing across AIA and HMI instruments, weak inter-class separability due to slow temporal evolution, and strong intra-class variability with sparse activity signals. Our pretraining framework employs a multi-granularity contrastive objective that jointly aligns (1) global class tokens across co-temporal AIA-HMI pairs to enhance temporal discrimination, (2) local patch tokens at fixed spatial indices to enforce position-consistent, modality-invariant features, and (3) intra-sample patches across different spatial locations to preserve fine-grained spatial structure. We train both CNN- and Vision Transformer-based autoencoders and demonstrate their effectiveness on two downstream tasks: cross-modal translation between HMI and AIA passbands via ControlNet, and full-disk flare classification. Experimental results show that SolarCHIP achieves state-of-the-art performance across both tasks, with particularly strong gains in low-resource settings where labeled data is limited. Ablation studies confirm that each contrastive component contributes essential discriminative capacity at different granularities. By publicly releasing pretrained weights and training code, we provide the heliophysics community with a practical, plug-and-play feature extractor that reduces computational requirements, improves label efficiency, and establishes a reusable foundation for diverse solar imaging applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Toward Equitable Access: Leveraging Crowdsourced Reviews to Investigate Public Perceptions of Health Resource Accessibility](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10641v2)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Monitoring health resource disparities during public health crises is critical, yet traditional methods, like surveys, lack the requisite speed and spatial granularity. This study introduces a novel framework that leverages: 1) crowdsourced Google Maps reviews (2018-2021) and 2) advanced NLP (DeBERTa) to create a high-resolution, spatial-temporal index of public perception of health resource accessibility in the United States. We then employ Partial Least Squares (PLS) regression to link this perception index to a range of socioeconomic and demographic drivers. Our results quantify significant spatial-temporal shifts in perceived access, confirming that disparities peaked during the COVID-19 crisis and only partially recovered post-peak. We identify political affiliation, racial composition, and educational attainment as primary determinants of these perceptions. This study validates a scalable method for real-time health equity monitoring and provides actionable evidence for interventions to build a more resilient healthcare infrastructure.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reverberation: Learning the Latencies Before Forecasting Trajectories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11164v2)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bridging the past to the future, connecting agents both spatially and temporally, lies at the core of the trajectory prediction task. Despite great efforts, it remains challenging to explicitly learn and predict latencies, i.e., response intervals or temporal delays with which agents respond to various trajectory-changing events and adjust their future paths, whether on their own or interactively. Different agents may exhibit distinct latency preferences for noticing, processing, and reacting to a specific trajectory-changing event. The lack of consideration of such latencies may undermine the causal continuity of forecasting systems, leading to implausible or unintended trajectories. Inspired by reverberation in acoustics, we propose a new reverberation transform and the corresponding Reverberation (short for Rev) trajectory prediction model, which predicts both individual latency preferences and their stochastic variations accordingly, by using two explicit and learnable reverberation kernels, enabling latency-conditioned and controllable trajectory prediction of both non-interactive and social latencies. Experiments on multiple datasets, whether pedestrians or vehicles, demonstrate that Rev achieves competitive accuracy while revealing interpretable latency dynamics across agents and scenarios. Qualitative analyses further verify the properties of the reverberation transform, highlighting its potential as a general latency modeling approach.</p></details> |  |

Traditional numerical weather prediction can be computationally intensive at high resolution and short lead times. In this work, we propose a lightweight UNet-based encoder-decoder augmented with axial-attention blocks that attend along image rows and columns to capture long-range spatial interactions, while temporal context is provided by conditioning on multiple past radar frames. Our hybrid architecture captures both local and long-range spatio-temporal dependencies from radar image sequences, enabling fixed lead-time precipitation nowcasting with modest compute. Experimental results on a preprocessed subset of the HKO-7 radar dataset demonstrate that our model outperforms ConvLSTM, pix2pix-style cGANs, and a plain UNet in pixel-fidelity metrics, reaching PSNR 47.67 and SSIM 0.9943. We report PSNR/SSIM here; extending evaluation to meteorology-oriented skill measures (e.g., CSI/FSS) is left to future work. The approach is simple, scalable, and effective for resource-constrained, real-time forecasting scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 3 figures.

Dodging such a sudden and fast projectile poses a significant challenge for UAVs, requiring ultra-low latency responses and agile maneuvers. Drawing inspiration from baseball, in which pitchers' body movements are analyzed to predict the ball's trajectory, we propose a novel real-time dodging system that leverages an RGB-D camera. Our approach integrates human pose estimation with depth information to predict the attacker's motion trajectory and the subsequent projectile trajectory. Additionally, we introduce an uncertainty-aware dodging strategy to enable the UAV to dodge incoming projectiles efficiently. Our perception system achieves high prediction accuracy and outperforms the baseline in effective distance and latency. The dodging strategy addresses temporal and spatial uncertainties to ensure UAV safety. Extensive real-world experiments demonstrate the framework's reliable dodging capabilities against sudden attacks and its outstanding robustness across diverse scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Tracking the Unstable: Appearance-Guided Motion Modeling for Robust Multi-Object Tracking in UAV-Captured Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01730v2)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-object tracking (MOT) aims to track multiple objects while maintaining consistent identities across frames of a given video. In unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) recorded videos, frequent viewpoint changes and complex UAV-ground relative motion dynamics pose significant challenges, which often lead to unstable affinity measurement and ambiguous association. Existing methods typically model motion and appearance cues separately, overlooking their spatio-temporal interplay and resulting in suboptimal tracking performance. In this work, we propose AMOT, which jointly exploits appearance and motion cues through two key components: an Appearance-Motion Consistency (AMC) matrix and a Motion-aware Track Continuation (MTC) module. Specifically, the AMC matrix computes bi-directional spatial consistency under the guidance of appearance features, enabling more reliable and context-aware identity association. The MTC module complements AMC by reactivating unmatched tracks through appearance-guided predictions that align with Kalman-based predictions, thereby reducing broken trajectories caused by missed detections. Extensive experiments on three UAV benchmarks, including VisDrone2019, UAVDT, and VT-MOT-UAV, demonstrate that our AMOT outperforms current state-of-the-art methods and generalizes well in a plug-and-play and training-free manner.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the AAAI26 Conference Main Track</p></details> |
| **[Alzheimer's Disease Prediction Using EffNetViTLoRA and BiLSTM with Multimodal Longitudinal MRI Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22774v1)** | 2025-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a prevalent neurodegenerative disorder that progressively impairs memory, decision-making, and overall cognitive function. As AD is irreversible, early prediction is critical for timely intervention and management. Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), a transitional stage between cognitively normal (CN) aging and AD, plays a significant role in early AD diagnosis. However, predicting MCI progression remains a significant challenge, as not all individuals with MCI convert to AD. MCI subjects are categorized into stable MCI (sMCI) and progressive MCI (pMCI) based on conversion status. In this study, we propose a generalized, end-to-end deep learning model for AD prediction using MCI cases from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Our hybrid architecture integrates Convolutional Neural Networks and Vision Transformers to capture both local spatial features and global contextual dependencies from Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans. To incorporate temporal progression, we further employ Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) networks to process features extracted from four consecutive MRI timepoints along with some other non-image biomarkers, predicting each subject's cognitive status at month 48. Our multimodal model achieved an average progression prediction accuracy of 95.05\% between sMCI and pMCI, outperforming existing studies in AD prediction. This work demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in longitudinal AD prediction and highlights the effectiveness of combining spatial and temporal modeling for the early detection of Alzheimer's disease.</p></details> |  |
| **[Weaver: Kronecker Product Approximations of Spatiotemporal Attention for Traffic Network Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08888v2)** | 2025-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatiotemporal forecasting on transportation networks is a complex task that requires understanding how traffic nodes interact within a dynamic, evolving system dictated by traffic flow dynamics and social behavioral patterns. The importance of transportation networks and ITS for modern mobility and commerce necessitates forecasting models that are not only accurate but also interpretable, efficient, and robust under structural or temporal perturbations. Recent approaches, particularly Transformer-based architectures, have improved predictive performance but often at the cost of high computational overhead and diminished architectural interpretability. In this work, we introduce Weaver, a novel attention-based model that applies Kronecker product approximations (KPA) to decompose the PN X PN spatiotemporal attention of O(P^2N^2) complexity into local P X P temporal and N X N spatial attention maps. This Kronecker attention map enables our Parallel-Kronecker Matrix-Vector product (P2-KMV) for efficient spatiotemporal message passing with O(P^2N + N^2P) complexity. To capture real-world traffic dynamics, we address the importance of negative edges in modeling traffic behavior by introducing Valence Attention using the continuous Tanimoto coefficient (CTC), which provides properties conducive to precise latent graph generation and training stability. To fully utilize the model's learning capacity, we introduce the Traffic Phase Dictionary for self-conditioning. Evaluations on PEMS-BAY and METR-LA show that Weaver achieves competitive performance across model categories while training more efficiently.</p></details> |  |

Building on the recent success of autoregressive modeling in both vision and language, our purely discrete approach jointly captures spatial and temporal dependencies within a single architecture. This unified design naturally supports a variety of generation tasks such as text-to-image, text-to-video, image-to-video, and long interactive video synthesis via straightforward temporal autoregression. Extensive experiments demonstrate that InfinityStar scores 83.74 on VBench, outperforming all autoregressive models by large margins, even surpassing some diffusion competitors like HunyuanVideo. Without extra optimizations, our model generates a 5s, 720p video approximately 10x faster than leading diffusion-based methods. To our knowledge, InfinityStar is the first discrete autoregressive video generator capable of producing industrial level 720p videos. We release all code and models to foster further research in efficient, high-quality video generation.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 Oral |

Accurate prostate segmentation is an important preliminary step for automating this process, enabling automated detection and diagnosis of PCa. However, existing deep-learning segmentation models are often trained on single-time-point and expertly annotated datasets, making them unsuitable for longitudinal AS analysis, where multiple time points and a scarcity of expert labels hinder their effective fine-tuning. To address these challenges, we propose MambaX-Net, a novel semi-supervised, dual-scan 3D segmentation architecture that computes the segmentation for time point t by leveraging the MRI and the corresponding segmentation mask from the previous time point. We introduce two new components: (i) a Mamba-enhanced Cross-Attention Module, which integrates the Mamba block into cross attention to efficiently capture temporal evolution and long-range spatial dependencies, and (ii) a Shape Extractor Module that encodes the previous segmentation mask into a latent anatomical representation for refined zone delination. Moreover, we introduce a semi-supervised self-training strategy that leverages pseudo-labels generated from a pre-trained nnU-Net, enabling effective learning without expert annotations. MambaX-Net was evaluated on a longitudinal AS dataset, and results showed that it significantly outperforms state-of-the-art U-Net and Transformer-based models, achieving superior prostate zone segmentation even when trained on limited and noisy data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Updat...</summary><p>Updated the acknowledgments section to include the UKRI Open Access statement</p></details> |

Traditional SLT methods are typically based on visible light videos, which are easily affected by factors such as lighting variations, rapid hand movements, and privacy concerns. This paper proposes the use of bio-inspired event cameras to alleviate the aforementioned issues. Specifically, we introduce a new high-definition event-based sign language dataset, termed Event-CSL, which effectively addresses the data scarcity in this research area. The dataset comprises 14,827 videos, 14,821 glosses, and 2,544 Chinese words in the text vocabulary. These samples are collected across diverse indoor and outdoor scenes, covering multiple viewpoints, lighting conditions, and camera motions. We have also benchmarked existing mainstream SLT methods on this dataset to facilitate fair comparisons in future research.Furthermore, we propose a novel event-based sign language translation framework, termed EvSLT. The framework first segments continuous video features into clips and employs a Mamba-based memory aggregation module to compress and aggregate spatial detail features at the clip level. Subsequently, these spatial features, along with temporal representations obtained from temporal convolution, are then fused by a graph-guided spatiotemporal fusion module. Extensive experiments on Event-CSL, as well as other publicly available datasets, demonstrate the superior performance of our method. The dataset and source code will be released on https://github.com/Event-AHU/OpenESL</p></details> |  |
| **[Cross-Modal Reconstruction Pretraining for Ramp Flow Prediction at Highway Interchanges](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03381v2)** | 2025-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Interchanges are crucial nodes for vehicle transfers between highways, yet the lack of real-time ramp detectors creates blind spots in traffic prediction. To address this, we propose a Spatio-Temporal Decoupled Autoencoder (STDAE), a two-stage framework that leverages cross-modal reconstruction pretraining. In the first stage, STDAE reconstructs historical ramp flows from mainline data, forcing the model to capture intrinsic spatio-temporal relations. Its decoupled architecture with parallel spatial and temporal autoencoders efficiently extracts heterogeneous features. In the prediction stage, the learned representations are integrated with models such as GWNet to enhance accuracy. Experiments on three real-world interchange datasets show that STDAE-GWNET consistently outperforms thirteen state-of-the-art baselines and achieves performance comparable to models using historical ramp data. This demonstrates its effectiveness in overcoming detector scarcity and its plug-and-play potential for diverse forecasting pipelines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Q-Net: Queue Length Estimation via Kalman-based Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24725v2)** | 2025-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Estimating queue lengths at signalized intersections is a long-standing challenge in traffic management. Partial observability of vehicle flows complicates this task despite the availability of two privacy preserving data sources: (i) aggregated vehicle counts from loop detectors near stop lines, and (ii) aggregated floating car data (aFCD) that provide segment-wise average speed measurements. However, how to integrate these sources with differing spatial and temporal resolutions for queue length estimation is rather unclear. Addressing this question, we present Q Net: a robust queue estimation framework built upon a state-space formulation. This formulation addresses key challenges in queue modeling, such as violations of traffic conservation assumptions. To overcome the limitations of standard filtering models in integrating diverse data sources, Q-Net employs an AI-augmented Kalman filter for estimation. Q-Net follows the Kalman predict-update framework and maintains physical interpretability, with internal variables linked to real-world traffic dynamics. Q-Net can be implemented in real-time, making it suitable for integration into queue-based traffic control systems. To achieve spatial transferability across road sections, we group aFCD measurements into fixed-size groups. This strategy ensures the dimension of Q-Net's learnable parameters is independent of section length. Evaluations on urban main roads in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, show that Q-Net outperforms baseline methods, accurately tracking queue formation and dissipation while correcting aFCD-induced delays. By combining data efficiency, interpretability, and strong transferability, Q Net makes accurate queue length estimation possible without costly sensing infrastructure like cameras or radar.</p></details> |  |
| **[RoadSceneBench: A Lightweight Benchmark for Mid-Level Road Scene Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22466v1)** | 2025-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding mid-level road semantics, which capture the structural and contextual cues that link low-level perception to high-level planning, is essential for reliable autonomous driving and digital map construction. However, existing benchmarks primarily target perception tasks such as detection or segmentation, overlooking the reasoning capabilities required to infer road topology and dynamic scene structure. To address this gap, we present RoadSceneBench, a lightweight yet information-rich benchmark designed to evaluate and advance visual reasoning in complex road environments. Unlike large-scale perception datasets, RoadSceneBench emphasizes relational understanding and structural consistency, encouraging models to capture the underlying logic of real-world road scenes. Furthermore, to enhance reasoning reliability, we propose Hierarchical Relational Reward Propagation with Temporal Consistency (HRRP-T), a training framework for Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in which reward signals adaptively promote spatial coherence and semantic alignment throughout the reasoning process. This paradigm enables models to move beyond static recognition toward geometry-aware and temporally consistent reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse road configurations. RoadSceneBench thus provides a compact yet powerful foundation for studying mid-level road semantics and fostering structure-aware autonomous perception. Our dataset is available at https://github.com/XiyanLiu/RoadSceneBench.</p></details> |  |

Current approaches often struggle to maintain view consistency while handling complex scene dynamics, particularly in large-scale environments with multiple interacting elements. This work introduces Dream4D, a novel framework that bridges this gap through a synergy of controllable video generation and neural 4D reconstruction. Our approach seamlessly combines a two-stage architecture: it first predicts optimal camera trajectories from a single image using few-shot learning, then generates geometrically consistent multi-view sequences via a specialized pose-conditioned diffusion process, which are finally converted into a persistent 4D representation. This framework is the first to leverage both rich temporal priors from video diffusion models and geometric awareness of the reconstruction models, which significantly facilitates 4D generation and shows higher quality (e.g., mPSNR, mSSIM) over existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://wanderer7-sk.github.io/Dream4D.github.io/</p></details> |

It natively supports interleaved contexts of up to 256K tokens, seamlessly integrating text, images, and video. The model family includes both dense (2B/4B/8B/32B) and mixture-of-experts (30B-A3B/235B-A22B) variants to accommodate diverse latency-quality trade-offs. Qwen3-VL delivers three core pillars: (i) markedly stronger pure-text understanding, surpassing comparable text-only backbones in several cases; (ii) robust long-context comprehension with a native 256K-token window for both text and interleaved multimodal inputs, enabling faithful retention, retrieval, and cross-referencing across long documents and videos; and (iii) advanced multimodal reasoning across single-image, multi-image, and video tasks, demonstrating leading performance on comprehensive evaluations such as MMMU and visual-math benchmarks (e.g., MathVista and MathVision). Architecturally, we introduce three key upgrades: (i) an enhanced interleaved-MRoPE for stronger spatial-temporal modeling across images and video; (ii) DeepStack integration, which effectively leverages multi-level ViT features to tighten vision-language alignment; and (iii) text-based time alignment for video, evolving from T-RoPE to explicit textual timestamp alignment for more precise temporal grounding. Under comparable token budgets and latency constraints, Qwen3-VL achieves superior performance in both dense and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures. We envision Qwen3-VL serving as a foundational engine for image-grounded reasoning, agentic decision-making, and multimodal code intelligence in real-world workflows.</p></details> | 42 pages |

This study evaluates two deep learning strategies for addressing this challenge: (1) a grid-to-grid approach, where gridded predictors are used to model rasterised targets (aggregation before modelling), and (2) a grid-to-point approach, where gridded predictors model point targets, followed by kriging interpolation to fill the domain (aggregation after modelling). Using groundwater storage data from Bangladesh as a case study, we compare the effcacy of these approaches. Our findings indicate that spatial interpolation is substantially more difficult than temporal prediction. In particular, nearest neighbours are not always the most similar, and uncertainties in geology strongly influence point temporal behaviour. These insights motivate future work on advanced interpolation methods informed by clustering locations based on time series dynamics. Demonstrated on groundwater storage, the conclusions are applicable to other environmental variables governed by indirectly observable factors.

Despite these achievements, current research predominantly focuses on pipeline and architectural designs, with comparatively little attention given to regularization methods, highlighting a critical gap in developing a comprehensive AI toolkit for this task. To bridge this gap, we propose motion label smoothing, a novel method that adapts the classic label smoothing strategy from classification to the sparse IMU-based motion capture task. Specifically, we first demonstrate that a naive adaptation of label smoothing, including simply blending a uniform vector or a ``uniform'' motion representation (e.g., dataset-average motion or a canonical T-pose), is suboptimal; and argue that a proper adaptation requires increasing the entropy of the smoothed labels. Second, we conduct a thorough analysis of human motion labels, identifying three critical properties: 1) Temporal Smoothness, 2) Joint Correlation, and 3) Low-Frequency Dominance, and show that conventional approaches to entropy enhancement (e.g., blending Gaussian noise) are ineffective as they disrupt these properties. Finally, we propose the blend of a novel skeleton-based Perlin noise for motion label smoothing, designed to raise label entropy while satisfying motion properties. Extensive experiments applying our motion label smoothing to three state-of-the-art methods across four real-world IMU datasets demonstrate its effectiveness and robust generalization (plug-and-play) capability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026</p></details> |

However, most existing models remain confined to single-image understanding, which greatly limits their applicability in clinical workflows. In practice, medical diagnosis and progression often require synthesizing information across multiple images from different modalities or time points. The development of medical MLLMs capable of such multi-image understanding has been hindered by the lack of large-scale, high-quality annotated training data. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework that leverages license-permissive compound images in biomedical literature, as a rich yet underutilized data source for multi-image analysis. Specifically, we design a five-stage, context-aware instruction generation paradigm underpinned by a divide-and-conquer strategy. By decomposing multi-image analysis into manageable sub-tasks, this paradigm empowers MLLMs to move beyond single-panel analysis and provide a composite understanding by learning the complex spatial, temporal, and cross-modal relationships inherent in these compound figures. By parsing over 237,000 compound figures and their contextual text for instruction generation, we develop M3LLM, a medical multi-image multi-modal large language model. For benchmarking, we construct PMC-MI-Bench for composite understanding, manually validated by medical experts. Extensive experiments show that M3LLM significantly outperforms both general-purpose and specialized medical MLLMs across multi-image, single-image, text-only, and multi-choice scenarios. Notably, M3LLM exhibits strong generalization to longitudinal chest X-ray analysis using the MIMIC dataset. This work establishes a scalable and efficient paradigm for developing medical MLLMs capable of composite reasoning, bridging the gap between biomedical literature and real-world clinical applications.</p></details> |  |

To address this issue, this paper presents an Appearance- and Relation-aware Parallel Graph attention fusion Network (ARPGNet) to learn mutually enhanced spatial-temporal representations of appearance and relation information. Specifically, we construct a facial region relation graph and leverage the graph attention mechanism to model the relationships between facial regions. The resulting relational representation sequences, along with CNN-based appearance representation sequences, are then fed into a parallel graph attention fusion module for mutual interaction and enhancement. This module simultaneously explores the complementarity between different representation sequences and the temporal dynamics within each sequence. Experimental results on three facial expression recognition datasets demonstrate that the proposed ARPGNet outperforms or is comparable to state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing.

However, existing methods in Micro-Action Recognition often overlook the inherent subtle changes in MAs, which limits the accuracy of distinguishing MAs with subtle changes. To address this issue, we present a novel Motion-guided Modulation Network (MMN) that implicitly captures and modulates subtle motion cues to enhance spatial-temporal representation learning. Specifically, we introduce a Motion-guided Skeletal Modulation module (MSM) to inject motion cues at the skeletal level, acting as a control signal to guide spatial representation modeling. In parallel, we design a Motion-guided Temporal Modulation module (MTM) to incorporate motion information at the frame level, facilitating the modeling of holistic motion patterns in micro-actions. Finally, we propose a motion consistency learning strategy to aggregate the motion cues from multi-scale features for micro-action classification. Experimental results on the Micro-Action 52 and iMiGUE datasets demonstrate that MMN achieves state-of-the-art performance in skeleton-based micro-action recognition, underscoring the importance of explicitly modeling subtle motion cues.

We introduce PrismAudio, the first framework to integrate Reinforcement Learning into V2A generation with specialized Chain-of-Thought (CoT) planning. Our approach decomposes monolithic reasoning into four specialized CoT modules (Semantic, Temporal, Aesthetic, and Spatial CoT), each paired with targeted reward functions. This CoT-reward correspondence enables multidimensional RL optimization that guides the model to jointly generate better reasoning across all perspectives, solving the objective entanglement problem while preserving interpretability. To make this optimization computationally practical, we propose Fast-GRPO, which employs hybrid ODE-SDE sampling that dramatically reduces the training overhead compared to existing GRPO implementations. We also introduce AudioCanvas, a rigorous benchmark that is more distributionally balanced and covers more realistically diverse and challenging scenarios than existing datasets, with 300 single-event classes and 501 multi-event samples.

However, their limited spatial resolution poses challenges for fine-grained perception tasks. In this work, we propose an ultra-lightweight, stream-based event-to-event super-resolution method based on Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), designed for real-time deployment on resource-constrained devices. To further reduce model size, we introduce a novel Dual-Forward Polarity-Split Event Encoding strategy that decouples positive and negative events into separate forward paths through a shared SNN. Furthermore, we propose a Learnable Spatio-temporal Polarity-aware Loss (LearnSTPLoss) that adaptively balances temporal, spatial, and polarity consistency using learnable uncertainty-based weights. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves competitive super-resolution performance on multiple datasets while significantly reducing model size and inference time. The lightweight design enables embedding the module into event cameras or using it as an efficient front-end preprocessing for downstream vision tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 10 figures, 7 tables, accepted by AAAI2026</p></details> |

Existing approaches (e.g., sparse sampling, dense sampling with low resolution, and token compression) suffer from significant information loss in temporal dynamics, spatial details, or subtle interactions, particularly in videos with complex motion or varying resolutions. To address this, we propose $\mathbf{Mavors}$, a novel framework that introduces $\mathbf{M}$ulti-gr$\mathbf{a}$nularity $\mathbf{v}$ide$\mathbf{o}$ $\mathbf{r}$epre$\mathbf{s}$entation for holistic long-video modeling. Specifically, Mavors directly encodes raw video content into latent representations through two core components: 1) an Intra-chunk Vision Encoder (IVE) that preserves high-resolution spatial features via 3D convolutions and Vision Transformers, and 2) an Inter-chunk Feature Aggregator (IFA) that establishes temporal coherence across chunks using transformer-based dependency modeling with chunk-level rotary position encodings. Moreover, the framework unifies image and video understanding by treating images as single-frame videos via sub-image decomposition. Experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate Mavors' superiority in maintaining both spatial fidelity and temporal continuity, significantly outperforming existing methods in tasks requiring fine-grained spatio-temporal reasoning.</p></details> | 22 pages |
| **[Seeing What Matters: Visual Preference Policy Optimization for Visual Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18719v2)** | 2025-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a powerful tool for post-training visual generative models, with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) increasingly used to align generators with human preferences. However, existing GRPO pipelines rely on a single scalar reward per sample, treating each image or video as a holistic entity and ignoring the rich spatial and temporal structure of visual content. This coarse supervision hinders the correction of localized artifacts and the modeling of fine-grained perceptual cues. We introduce Visual Preference Policy Optimization (ViPO), a GRPO variant that lifts scalar feedback into structured, pixel-level advantages. ViPO employs a Perceptual Structuring Module that uses pretrained vision backbones to construct spatially and temporally aware advantage maps, redistributing optimization pressure toward perceptually important regions while preserving the stability of standard GRPO. Across both image and video benchmarks, ViPO consistently outperforms vanilla GRPO, improving in-domain alignment with human-preference rewards and enhancing generalization on out-of-domain evaluations. The method is architecture-agnostic, lightweight, and fully compatible with existing GRPO training pipelines, providing a more expressive and informative learning signal for visual generation.</p></details> |  |

This capability is essential for applications in cognitive radio, spectrum monitoring, and intelligent communication networks. We propose an AMC system based on a hybrid Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture, integrated with a Software Defined Radio (SDR) platform. The proposed architecture leverages CNNs for spatial feature extraction and LSTMs for capturing temporal dependencies, enabling efficient handling of complex, time-varying communication signals. The system's practical ability was demonstrated by identifying over-the-air (OTA) signals from a custom-built FM transmitter alongside other modulation schemes. The system was trained on a hybrid dataset combining the RadioML2018 dataset with a custom-generated dataset, featuring samples at Signal-to-Noise Ratios (SNRs) from 0 to 30dB. System performance was evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC-ROC). The optimized model achieved 93.48% accuracy, 93.53% precision, 93.48% recall, and an F1 score of 93.45%. The AUC-ROC analysis confirmed the model's discriminative power, even in noisy conditions. This paper's experimental results validate the effectiveness of the hybrid CNN-LSTM architecture for AMC, suggesting its potential application in adaptive spectrum management and advanced cognitive radio systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 Pag...</summary><p>7 Pages, 11 figures, 2 Tables, Accepted in Journal (Journal of Innovations in Engineering Education)</p></details> |

However, current research focuses on simple video scenarios, failing to reflect the complex and diverse nature of real-world audio-visual events in videos. To bridge this gap, we firstly introduce R-AVST, a dataset for audio-visual reasoning featuring fine-grained spatio-temporal annotations. In constructing this, we design a pipeline consisting of LLM-based key object extraction, automatic spatial annotation and manual quality inspection, resulting in over 5K untrimmed videos with 27K objects across 100 types of audio-visual events. Building on this dataset, we define three core tasks for spatio-temporal reasoning in audio-visual scenes and generate more than 8K high-quality, evenly distributed question-answer pairs to effectively benchmark model performance. To further enhance reasoning, we propose AVST-Zero, a reinforcement learning-based model that avoids intermediate supervision, directly optimizing behavior via carefully designed multi-dimensional rewards. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our R-AVST in advancing audio-visual spatio-temporal reasoning, upon which AVST-Zero demonstrates competitive performance compared to existing models. To the best of our knowledge, R-AVST is the first dataset designed for real-world audio-visual spatio-temporal reasoning, and AVST-Zero offers a novel perspective for tackling future challenges in this domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026.

PDE-FM combines spatial-spectral tokenization, physics-aware conditioning, and a Mamba-based state-space backbone with an operator-theoretic decoder, enabling scalable and data-efficient modeling of complex physical dynamics. In contrast to task-specific neural operators, PDE-FM is pretrained once on diverse PDE datasets and can be transferred to new physical regimes without architectural or data-specific modifications. Evaluated on twelve 2D and 3D datasets from The Well benchmark - spanning hydrodynamic, radiative, elastic, and astrophysical phenomena - PDE-FM achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in six domains, reducing mean VRMSE by 46% relative to prior operator-learning baselines. The model demonstrates robust cross-physics generalization, excelling in turbulent and radiative systems while maintaining strong performance in linear and steady-state regimes. These results suggest that large-scale pretraining across diverse physical processes can yield transferable representations of dynamics, marking a step toward unified, foundation-level surrogates for multi-physics simulation and scientific discovery.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the AAAI 2026 AI2ASE Workshop</p></details> |
| **[ENMA: Tokenwise Autoregression for Generative Neural PDE Operators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06158v2)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Solving time-dependent parametric partial differential equations (PDEs) remains a fundamental challenge for neural solvers, particularly when generalizing across a wide range of physical parameters and dynamics. When data is uncertain or incomplete-as is often the case-a natural approach is to turn to generative models. We introduce ENMA, a generative neural operator designed to model spatio-temporal dynamics arising from physical phenomena. ENMA predicts future dynamics in a compressed latent space using a generative masked autoregressive transformer trained with flow matching loss, enabling tokenwise generation. Irregularly sampled spatial observations are encoded into uniform latent representations via attention mechanisms and further compressed through a spatio-temporal convolutional encoder. This allows ENMA to perform in-context learning at inference time by conditioning on either past states of the target trajectory or auxiliary context trajectories with similar dynamics. The result is a robust and adaptable framework that generalizes to new PDE regimes and supports one-shot surrogate modeling of time-dependent parametric PDEs.</p></details> |  |
| **[EvRainDrop: HyperGraph-guided Completion for Effective Frame and Event Stream Aggregation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21439v1)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Event cameras produce asynchronous event streams that are spatially sparse yet temporally dense. Mainstream event representation learning algorithms typically use event frames, voxels, or tensors as input. Although these approaches have achieved notable progress, they struggle to address the undersampling problem caused by spatial sparsity. In this paper, we propose a novel hypergraph-guided spatio-temporal event stream completion mechanism, which connects event tokens across different times and spatial locations via hypergraphs and leverages contextual information message passing to complete these sparse events. The proposed method can flexibly incorporate RGB tokens as nodes in the hypergraph within this completion framework, enabling multi-modal hypergraph-based information completion. Subsequently, we aggregate hypergraph node information across different time steps through self-attention, enabling effective learning and fusion of multi-modal features. Extensive experiments on both single- and multi-label event classification tasks fully validated the effectiveness of our proposed framework. The source code of this paper will be released on https://github.com/Event-AHU/EvRainDrop.</p></details> |  |
| **[Thinking With Bounding Boxes: Enhancing Spatio-Temporal Video Grounding via Reinforcement Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21375v1)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal video grounding (STVG) requires localizing a target object in untrimmed videos both temporally and spatially from natural language descriptions. Despite their strong language understanding, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) underperform on STVG due to misaligned training objectives and weak fine-grained region-word alignment in standard visual encoders. To address this, we propose STVG-o1, the first framework that enables off-the-shelf MLLMs to achieve state-of-the-art STVG performance without any architectural modifications. Our method introduces a bounding-box chain-of-thought mechanism that explicitly reasons about spatio-temporal locations in an intermediate step before producing the final prediction. We further design a multi-dimensional reinforcement reward function consisting of format, consistency, temporal, spatial, and think rewards, which provides geometry-aware supervision through reinforcement fine-tuning. Evaluated on HCSTVG-v1/v2 and VidSTG, STVG-o1 sets new state-of-the-art results on HCSTVG, outperforming the best task-specific method by 7.3\% m\_tIoU on HCSTVG-v1, matching specialized models on VidSTG, and surpassing all existing MLLM-based approaches by large margins. It also demonstrates strong open-vocabulary generalization across datasets, establishing MLLMs as viable and powerful backbones for precise spatio-temporal grounding. Our code and models will be released.</p></details> |  |
| **[HTTM: Head-wise Temporal Token Merging for Faster VGGT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21317v1)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Visual Geometry Grounded Transformer (VGGT) marks a significant leap forward in 3D scene reconstruction, as it is the first model that directly infers all key 3D attributes (camera poses, depths, and dense geometry) jointly in one pass. However, this joint inference mechanism requires global attention layers that perform all-to-all attention computation on tokens from all views. For reconstruction of large scenes with long-sequence inputs, this causes a significant latency bottleneck. In this paper, we propose head-wise temporal merging (HTTM), a training-free 3D token merging method for accelerating VGGT. Existing merging techniques merge tokens uniformly across different attention heads, resulting in identical tokens in the layers' output, which hinders the model's representational ability. HTTM tackles this problem by merging tokens in multi-head granularity, which preserves the uniqueness of feature tokens after head concatenation. Additionally, this enables HTTM to leverage the spatial locality and temporal correspondence observed at the head level to achieve higher merging ratios with lower merging costs compared to existing methods. Thus, HTTM achieves up to 7x acceleration with negligible performance drops in a GPU-based inference.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards an Effective Action-Region Tracking Framework for Fine-grained Video Action Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21202v1)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine-grained action recognition (FGAR) aims to identify subtle and distinctive differences among fine-grained action categories. However, current recognition methods often capture coarse-grained motion patterns but struggle to identify subtle details in local regions evolving over time. In this work, we introduce the Action-Region Tracking (ART) framework, a novel solution leveraging a query-response mechanism to discover and track the dynamics of distinctive local details, enabling effective distinction of similar actions. Specifically, we propose a region-specific semantic activation module that employs discriminative and text-constrained semantics as queries to capture the most action-related region responses in each video frame, facilitating interaction among spatial and temporal dimensions with corresponding video features. The captured region responses are organized into action tracklets, which characterize region-based action dynamics by linking related responses across video frames in a coherent sequence. The text-constrained queries encode nuanced semantic representations derived from textual descriptions of action labels extracted by language branches within Visual Language Models (VLMs). To optimize the action tracklets, we design a multi-level tracklet contrastive constraint among region responses at spatial and temporal levels, enabling effective discrimination within each frame and correlation between adjacent frames. Additionally, a task-specific fine-tuning mechanism refines textual semantics such that semantic representations encoded by VLMs are preserved while optimized for task preferences. Comprehensive experiments on widely used action recognition benchmarks demonstrate the superiority to previous state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Privacy in Federated Learning with Spiking Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21181v1)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have emerged as prominent candidates for embedded and edge AI. Their inherent low power consumption makes them far more efficient than conventional ANNs in scenarios where energy budgets are tightly constrained. In parallel, federated learning (FL) has become the prevailing training paradigm in such settings, enabling on-device learning while limiting the exposure of raw data. However, gradient inversion attacks represent a critical privacy threat in FL, where sensitive training data can be reconstructed directly from shared gradients. While this vulnerability has been widely investigated in conventional ANNs, its implications for SNNs remain largely unexplored. In this work, we present the first comprehensive empirical study of gradient leakage in SNNs across diverse data domains. SNNs are inherently non-differentiable and are typically trained using surrogate gradients, which we hypothesized would be less correlated with the original input and thus less informative from a privacy perspective. To investigate this, we adapt different gradient leakage attacks to the spike domain. Our experiments reveal a striking contrast with conventional ANNs: whereas ANN gradients reliably expose salient input content, SNN gradients yield noisy, temporally inconsistent reconstructions that fail to recover meaningful spatial or temporal structure. These results indicate that the combination of event-driven dynamics and surrogate-gradient training substantially reduces gradient informativeness. To the best of our knowledge, this work provides the first systematic benchmark of gradient inversion attacks for spiking architectures, highlighting the inherent privacy-preserving potential of neuromorphic computation.</p></details> |  |

The SAM2 model, pretrained on natural videos, offers potential for zero-shot surgical segmentation, but its applicability in complex surgical environments, with challenges like tissue deformation and instrument variability, remains unexplored. We present the first comprehensive evaluation of the zero-shot capability of SAM2 in 9 surgical datasets (17 surgery types), covering laparoscopic, endoscopic, and robotic procedures. We analyze various prompting (points, boxes, mask) and {finetuning (dense, sparse) strategies}, robustness to surgical challenges, and generalization across procedures and anatomies. Key findings reveal that while SAM2 demonstrates notable zero-shot adaptability in structured scenarios (e.g., instrument segmentation, {multi-organ segmentation}, and scene segmentation), its performance varies under dynamic surgical conditions, highlighting gaps in handling temporal coherence and domain-specific artifacts. These results highlight future pathways to adaptive data-efficient solutions for the surgical data science field.</p></details> |  |
| **[Referring Video Object Segmentation with Cross-Modality Proxy Queries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21139v1)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Referring video object segmentation (RVOS) is an emerging cross-modality task that aims to generate pixel-level maps of the target objects referred by given textual expressions. The main concept involves learning an accurate alignment of visual elements and language expressions within a semantic space. Recent approaches address cross-modality alignment through conditional queries, tracking the target object using a query-response based mechanism built upon transformer structure. However, they exhibit two limitations: (1) these conditional queries lack inter-frame dependency and variation modeling, making accurate target tracking challenging amid significant frame-to-frame variations; and (2) they integrate textual constraints belatedly, which may cause the video features potentially focus on the non-referred objects. Therefore, we propose a novel RVOS architecture called ProxyFormer, which introduces a set of proxy queries to integrate visual and text semantics and facilitate the flow of semantics between them. By progressively updating and propagating proxy queries across multiple stages of video feature encoder, ProxyFormer ensures that the video features are focused on the object of interest. This dynamic evolution also enables the establishment of inter-frame dependencies, enhancing the accuracy and coherence of object tracking. To mitigate high computational costs, we decouple cross-modality interactions into temporal and spatial dimensions. Additionally, we design a Joint Semantic Consistency (JSC) training strategy to align semantic consensus between the proxy queries and the combined video-text pairs. Comprehensive experiments on four widely used RVOS benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our ProxyFormer to the state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-scale Temporal Prediction via Incremental Generation and Multi-agent Collaboration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17429v3)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate temporal prediction is the bridge between comprehensive scene understanding and embodied artificial intelligence. However, predicting multiple fine-grained states of a scene at multiple temporal scales is difficult for vision-language models. We formalize the Multi-Scale Temporal Prediction (MSTP) task in general and surgical scenes by decomposing multi-scale into two orthogonal dimensions: the temporal scale, forecasting states of humans and surgery at varying look-ahead intervals, and the state scale, modeling a hierarchy of states in general and surgical scenes. For example, in general scenes, states of contact relationships are finer-grained than states of spatial relationships. In surgical scenes, medium-level steps are finer-grained than high-level phases yet remain constrained by their encompassing phase. To support this unified task, we introduce the first MSTP Benchmark, featuring synchronized annotations across multiple state scales and temporal scales. We further propose a method, Incremental Generation and Multi-agent Collaboration (IG-MC), which integrates two key innovations. First, we present a plug-and-play incremental generation module that continuously synthesizes up-to-date visual previews at expanding temporal scales to inform multiple decision-making agents, keeping decisions and generated visuals synchronized and preventing performance degradation as look-ahead intervals lengthen. Second, we present a decision-driven multi-agent collaboration framework for multi-state prediction, comprising generation, initiation, and multi-state assessment agents that dynamically trigger and evaluate prediction cycles to balance global coherence and local fidelity.</p></details> | 20 pages, 6 figures |

However, effective fusion of geometry-based 3DGS and appearance-driven diffusion models faces inherent challenges, as the absence of pixel-wise, 3D-consistent editing criteria often leads to over-restoration and geometric drift. To address these issues, we introduce \textbf{FaithFusion}, a 3DGS-diffusion fusion framework driven by pixel-wise Expected Information Gain (EIG). EIG acts as a unified policy for coherent spatio-temporal synthesis: it guides diffusion as a spatial prior to refine high-uncertainty regions, while its pixel-level weighting distills the edits back into 3DGS. The resulting plug-and-play system is free from extra prior conditions and structural modifications.Extensive experiments on the Waymo dataset demonstrate that our approach attains SOTA performance across NTA-IoU, NTL-IoU, and FID, maintaining an FID of 107.47 even at 6 meters lane shift.

However, their robustness is still challenged by variations in rotation, scale, specular reflections, and defocus blur. In addition, most existing approaches rely on straightforward point-to-point comparisons, typically using cosine or L2 distance, without effectively leveraging the spatio-spatial-temporal structure of iris patterns. To address these limitations, we propose a novel and generalized matching pipeline that learns rich spatio-spatial-temporal representations of iris features. Our approach first splits each iris image along one dimension, generating a sequence of sub-images that serve as input to a 3D-CNN, enabling the network to capture both spatial and spatio-spatial-temporal cues. To further enhance the modeling of spatio-spatial-temporal feature dynamics, we train the model in curriculum manner. This design allows the network to embed temporal dependencies directly into the feature space, improving discriminability in the deep metric domain. The framework is trained end-to-end with triplet and ArcFace loss in a curriculum manner, enforcing highly discriminative embeddings despite challenges like rotation, scale, reflections, and blur. This design yields a robust and generalizable solution for iris authentication.Github code: https://github.com/GeetanjaliGTZ/CLRecogEye</p></details> | <details><summary>12 Pa...</summary><p>12 Pages, 3 figures, ISVC conference 2025</p></details> |
| **[SOAP: Enhancing Spatio-Temporal Relation and Motion Information Capturing for Few-Shot Action Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16344v4)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High frame-rate (HFR) videos of action recognition improve fine-grained expression while reducing the spatio-temporal relation and motion information density. Thus, large amounts of video samples are continuously required for traditional data-driven training. However, samples are not always sufficient in real-world scenarios, promoting few-shot action recognition (FSAR) research. We observe that most recent FSAR works build spatio-temporal relation of video samples via temporal alignment after spatial feature extraction, cutting apart spatial and temporal features within samples. They also capture motion information via narrow perspectives between adjacent frames without considering density, leading to insufficient motion information capturing. Therefore, we propose a novel plug-and-play architecture for FSAR called Spatio-tempOral frAme tuPle enhancer (SOAP) in this paper. The model we designed with such architecture refers to SOAP-Net. Temporal connections between different feature channels and spatio-temporal relation of features are considered instead of simple feature extraction. Comprehensive motion information is also captured, using frame tuples with multiple frames containing more motion information than adjacent frames. Combining frame tuples of diverse frame counts further provides a broader perspective. SOAP-Net achieves new state-of-the-art performance across well-known benchmarks such as SthSthV2, Kinetics, UCF101, and HMDB51. Extensive empirical evaluations underscore the competitiveness, pluggability, generalization, and robustness of SOAP.

Existing methods for closure modeling are often computationally prohibitive, lack uncertainty quantification, or require noise-free observations of the temporal derivatives over the system state. We propose a novel, computationally efficient approach for the modeling and estimation of closure terms over the spatiotemporal domain that provides uncertainty quantification and is effective even when the observations of the system state are sparse or contain moderate levels of noise. The efficacy of our approach is demonstrated in both one and two spatial dimensions through numerical experiments using the Fisher-KPP reaction-diffusion equation and the advection-diffusion equation as exemplars.</p></details> |  |
