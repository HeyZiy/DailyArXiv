| **[BinConv: A Neural Architecture for Ordinal Encoding in Time-Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24595v3)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent work in time series forecasting has explored reformulating regression as a classification task. By discretizing the continuous target space into bins and predicting over a fixed set of classes, these approaches benefit from more stable training, improved uncertainty modeling, and compatibility with modern deep learning architectures. However, most existing methods rely on one-hot encoding, which ignores the inherent ordinal structure of the target values. As a result, they fail to convey information about the relative distance between predicted and true values during training. In this paper, we address this limitation by applying \textbf{Cumulative Binary Encoding} (CBE), a monotonic binary representation that transforms both model inputs and outputs. CBE implicitly preserves ordinal and magnitude information, allowing models to learn distance aware representations while operating within a classification framework. To leverage CBE effectively, we propose \textbf{BinConv}, a fully convolutional neural network architecture designed for probabilistic forecasting. We demonstrate that standard fully connected layers are not only less computationally efficient than convolutional layers when used with CBE, but also degrade forecasting performance. Our experiments on standard benchmark datasets show that BinConv achieves superior performance compared to widely used baselines in both point and probabilistic forecasting, while requiring fewer parameters and enabling faster training.</p></details> |  |
| **[FinCast: A Foundation Model for Financial Time-Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19609v1)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Financial time-series forecasting is critical for maintaining economic stability, guiding informed policymaking, and promoting sustainable investment practices. However, it remains challenging due to various underlying pattern shifts. These shifts arise primarily from three sources: temporal non-stationarity (distribution changes over time), multi-domain diversity (distinct patterns across financial domains such as stocks, commodities, and futures), and varying temporal resolutions (patterns differing across per-second, hourly, daily, or weekly indicators). While recent deep learning methods attempt to address these complexities, they frequently suffer from overfitting and typically require extensive domain-specific fine-tuning. To overcome these limitations, we introduce FinCast, the first foundation model specifically designed for financial time-series forecasting, trained on large-scale financial datasets. Remarkably, FinCast exhibits robust zero-shot performance, effectively capturing diverse patterns without domain-specific fine-tuning. Comprehensive empirical and qualitative evaluations demonstrate that FinCast surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its strong generalization capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Functional Time Series Forecasting of Distributions: A Koopman-Wasserstein Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07570v2)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a novel method for forecasting the temporal evolution of probability distributions observed at discrete time points. Extending the Dynamic Probability Density Decomposition (DPDD), we embed distributional dynamics into Wasserstein geometry via a Koopman operator framework. Our approach introduces an importance-weighted variant of Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition (EDMD), enabling accurate, closed-form forecasts in 2-Wasserstein space. Theoretical guarantees are established: our estimator achieves spectral convergence and optimal finite-sample Wasserstein error. Simulation studies and a real-world application to U.S. housing price distributions show substantial improvements over existing methods such as Wasserstein Autoregression. By integrating optimal transport, functional time series modeling, and spectral operator theory, DPDD offers a scalable and interpretable solution for distributional forecasting. This work has broad implications for behavioral science, public health, finance, and neuroimaging--domains where evolving distributions arise naturally. Our framework contributes to functional data analysis on non-Euclidean spaces and provides a general tool for modeling and forecasting distributional time series.</p></details> | revised |
| **[Forecasting Multivariate Urban Data via Decomposition and Spatio-Temporal Graph Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22474v2)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long-term forecasting of multivariate urban data poses a significant challenge due to the complex spatiotemporal dependencies inherent in such datasets. This paper presents DST, a novel multivariate time-series forecasting model that integrates graph attention and temporal convolution within a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to effectively capture spatial and temporal dependencies, respectively. To enhance model performance, we apply a decomposition-based preprocessing step that isolates trend, seasonal, and residual components of the time series, enabling the learning of distinct graph structures for different time-series components. Extensive experiments on real-world urban datasets, including electricity demand, weather metrics, carbon intensity, and air pollution, demonstrate the effectiveness of DST across a range of forecast horizons, from several days to one month. Specifically, our approach achieves an average improvement of 2.89% to 9.10% in long-term forecasting accuracy over state-of-the-art time-series forecasting models.</p></details> |  |
| **[PAX-TS: Model-agnostic multi-granular explanations for time series forecasting via localized perturbations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18982v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting has seen considerable improvement during the last years, with transformer models and large language models driving advancements of the state of the art. Modern forecasting models are generally opaque and do not provide explanations for their forecasts, while well-known post-hoc explainability methods like LIME are not suitable for the forecasting context. We propose PAX-TS, a model-agnostic post-hoc algorithm to explain time series forecasting models and their forecasts. Our method is based on localized input perturbations and results in multi-granular explanations. Further, it is able to characterize cross-channel correlations for multivariate time series forecasts. We clearly outline the algorithmic procedure behind PAX-TS, demonstrate it on a benchmark with 7 algorithms and 10 diverse datasets, compare it with two other state-of-the-art explanation algorithms, and present the different explanation types of the method. We found that the explanations of high-performing and low-performing algorithms differ on the same datasets, highlighting that the explanations of PAX-TS effectively capture a model's behavior. Based on time step correlation matrices resulting from the benchmark, we identify 6 classes of patterns that repeatedly occur across different datasets and algorithms. We found that the patterns are indicators of performance, with noticeable differences in forecasting error between the classes. Lastly, we outline a multivariate example where PAX-TS demonstrates how the forecasting model takes cross-channel correlations into account. With PAX-TS, time series forecasting models' mechanisms can be illustrated in different levels of detail, and its explanations can be used to answer practical questions on forecasts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning the Simplest Neural ODE](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02019v3)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Since the advent of the ``Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (Neural ODE)'' paper, learning ODEs with deep learning has been applied to system identification, time-series forecasting, and related areas. Exploiting the diffeomorphic nature of ODE solution maps, neural ODEs has also enabled their use in generative modeling. Despite the rich potential to incorporate various kinds of physical information, training Neural ODEs remains challenging in practice. This study demonstrates, through the simplest one-dimensional linear model, why training Neural ODEs is difficult. We then propose a new stabilization method and provide an analytical convergence analysis. The insights and techniques presented here serve as a concise tutorial for researchers beginning work on Neural ODEs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted SICE FES 2025</p></details> |
| **[STRATA-TS: Selective Knowledge Transfer for Urban Time Series Forecasting with Retrieval-Guided Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18635v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Urban forecasting models often face a severe data imbalance problem: only a few cities have dense, long-span records, while many others expose short or incomplete histories. Direct transfer from data-rich to data-scarce cities is unreliable because only a limited subset of source patterns truly benefits the target domain, whereas indiscriminate transfer risks introducing noise and negative transfer. We present STRATA-TS (Selective TRAnsfer via TArget-aware retrieval for Time Series), a framework that combines domain-adapted retrieval with reasoning-capable large models to improve forecasting in scarce data regimes. STRATA-TS employs a patch-based temporal encoder to identify source subsequences that are semantically and dynamically aligned with the target query. These retrieved exemplars are then injected into a retrieval-guided reasoning stage, where an LLM performs structured inference over target inputs and retrieved support. To enable efficient deployment, we distill the reasoning process into a compact open model via supervised fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on three parking availability datasets across Singapore, Nottingham, and Glasgow demonstrate that STRATA-TS consistently outperforms strong forecasting and transfer baselines, while providing interpretable knowledge transfer pathways.</p></details> |  |
| **[A foundation model with multi-variate parallel attention to generate neuronal activity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20354v2)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning from multi-variate time-series with heterogeneous channel configurations remains a fundamental challenge for deep neural networks, particularly in clinical domains such as intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG), where channel setups vary widely across subjects. In this work, we introduce multi-variate parallel attention (MVPA), a novel self-attention mechanism that disentangles content, temporal, and spatial attention, enabling flexible, generalizable, and efficient modeling of time-series data with varying channel counts and configurations. We use MVPA to build MVPFormer, a generative foundation model for human electrophysiology, trained to predict the evolution of iEEG signals across diverse subjects. To support this and future efforts by the community, we release the SWEC iEEG dataset, the largest publicly available iEEG dataset to date, comprising nearly 10,000 hours of recordings from heterogeneous clinical sources. MVPFormer leverages MVPA to achieve strong generalization across subjects, demonstrating expert-level performance in several iEEG tasks. MVPFormer surpasses state-of-the-art Transformer baselines in seizure detection across the SWEC, the MAYO, and the FNUSA datasets, while also achieving state-of-the-art performance on four Brain TreeBank iEEG decoding tasks. We further validate MVPA on standard time-series forecasting and classification tasks, where it matches or exceeds the performance of existing attention-based models. Together, our contributions establish MVPA as a general-purpose attention mechanism for heterogeneous time-series and MVPFormer as the first open-source, open-weights, and open-data iEEG foundation model with SOTA clinical performance.

| **[GateTS: Versatile and Efficient Forecasting via Attention-Inspired routed Mixture-of-Experts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17515v1)** | 2025-08-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate univariate forecasting remains a pressing need in real-world systems, such as energy markets, hydrology, retail demand, and IoT monitoring, where signals are often intermittent and horizons span both short- and long-term. While transformers and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures are increasingly favored for time-series forecasting, a key gap persists: MoE models typically require complicated training with both the main forecasting loss and auxiliary load-balancing losses, along with careful routing/temperature tuning, which hinders practical adoption. In this paper, we propose a model architecture that simplifies the training process for univariate time series forecasting and effectively addresses both long- and short-term horizons, including intermittent patterns. Our approach combines sparse MoE computation with a novel attention-inspired gating mechanism that replaces the traditional one-layer softmax router. Through extensive empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that our gating design naturally promotes balanced expert utilization and achieves superior predictive accuracy without requiring the auxiliary load-balancing losses typically used in classical MoE implementations. The model achieves better performance while utilizing only a fraction of the parameters required by state-of-the-art transformer models, such as PatchTST. Furthermore, experiments across diverse datasets confirm that our MoE architecture with the proposed gating mechanism is more computationally efficient than LSTM for both long- and short-term forecasting, enabling cost-effective inference. These results highlight the potential of our approach for practical time-series forecasting applications where both accuracy and computational efficiency are critical.</p></details> |  |
| **[FLAIRR-TS -- Forecasting LLM-Agents with Iterative Refinement and Retrieval for Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19279v1)** | 2025-08-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series Forecasting with large languagemodels (LLMs) requires bridging numericalpatterns and natural language. Effective fore-casting on LLM often relies on extensive pre-processing and fine-tuning.Recent studiesshow that a frozen LLM can rival specializedforecasters when supplied with a carefully en-gineered natural-language prompt, but craft-ing such a prompt for each task is itself oner-ous and ad-hoc. We introduce FLAIRR-TS, atest-time prompt optimization framework thatutilizes an agentic system: a Forecaster-agentgenerates forecasts using an initial prompt,which is then refined by a refiner agent, in-formed by past outputs and retrieved analogs.This adaptive prompting generalizes across do-mains using creative prompt templates andgenerates high-quality forecasts without inter-mediate code generation.Experiments onbenchmark datasets show improved accuracyover static prompting and retrieval-augmentedbaselines, approaching the performance ofspecialized prompts.FLAIRR-TS providesa practical alternative to tuning, achievingstrong performance via its agentic approach toadaptive prompt refinement and retrieval.</p></details> | EMNLP |
| **[Uncertainty Propagation Networks for Neural Ordinary Differential Equations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16815v1)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces Uncertainty Propagation Network (UPN), a novel family of neural differential equations that naturally incorporate uncertainty quantification into continuous-time modeling. Unlike existing neural ODEs that predict only state trajectories, UPN simultaneously model both state evolution and its associated uncertainty by parameterizing coupled differential equations for mean and covariance dynamics. The architecture efficiently propagates uncertainty through nonlinear dynamics without discretization artifacts by solving coupled ODEs for state and covariance evolution while enabling state-dependent, learnable process noise. The continuous-depth formulation adapts its evaluation strategy to each input's complexity, provides principled uncertainty quantification, and handles irregularly-sampled observations naturally. Experimental results demonstrate UPN's effectiveness across multiple domains: continuous normalizing flows (CNFs) with uncertainty quantification, time-series forecasting with well-calibrated confidence intervals, and robust trajectory prediction in both stable and chaotic dynamical systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[PENGUIN: Enhancing Transformer with Periodic-Nested Group Attention for Long-term Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13773v2)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long-term time series forecasting (LTSF) is a fundamental task with wide-ranging applications. Although Transformer-based models have made significant breakthroughs in forecasting, their effectiveness for time series forecasting remains debatable. In this paper, we revisit the significance of self-attention and propose a simple yet effective mechanism, Periodic-Nested Group Attention, namely PENGUIN. Our approach highlights the importance of explicitly modeling periodic patterns and incorporating relative attention bias for effective time series modeling. To this end, we introduce a periodic-nested relative attention bias that captures periodic structures directly. To handle multiple coexisting periodicities (e.g., daily and weekly cycles), we design a grouped attention mechanism, where each group targets a specific periodicity using a multi-query attention mechanism. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that PENGUIN consistently outperforms both MLP-based and Transformer-based models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Integrating Time Series into LLMs via Multi-layer Steerable Embedding Fusion for Enhanced Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16059v1)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series (TS) data are ubiquitous across various application areas, rendering time series forecasting (TSF) a fundamental task. With the astounding advances in large language models (LLMs), a variety of methods have been developed to adapt LLMs for time series forecasting. Despite unlocking the potential of LLMs in comprehending TS data, existing methods are inherently constrained by their shallow integration of TS information, wherein LLMs typically access TS representations at shallow layers, primarily at the input layer. This causes the influence of TS representations to progressively fade in deeper layers and eventually leads to ineffective adaptation between textual embeddings and TS representations. In this paper, we propose the Multi-layer Steerable Embedding Fusion (MSEF), a novel framework that enables LLMs to directly access time series patterns at all depths, thereby mitigating the progressive loss of TS information in deeper layers. Specifically, MSEF leverages off-the-shelf time series foundation models to extract semantically rich embeddings, which are fused with intermediate text representations across LLM layers via layer-specific steering vectors. These steering vectors are designed to continuously optimize the alignment between time series and textual modalities and facilitate a layer-specific adaptation mechanism that ensures efficient few-shot learning capabilities. Experimental results on seven benchmarks demonstrate significant performance improvements by MSEF compared with baselines, with an average reduction of 31.8% in terms of MSE. The code is available at https://github.com/One1sAll/MSEF.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published in CIKM 2025</p></details> |
| **[Evaluation of Time Series Forecasting Models for Predicting Lung Cancer Mortality Rates in the United States: A Comparison with Altuhaifa (2023) Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16052v1)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper evaluates the performance of the following time series forecasting models - Simple Exponential Smoothing (SES), Holt's Double Exponential Smoothing (HDES), and Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) - in predicting lung cancer mortality rates in the United States. It builds upon the work of Altuhaifa, which used Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) data from 1975-2018 to evaluate these models. Altuhaifa's study found that ARIMA (0,2,2), SES with smoothing parameter $\alpha=0.995$, and HDES with parameters $\alpha=0.4$ and $\beta=0.9$ were the optimal models from their analysis, with HDES providing the lowest Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 132.91. The paper extends the dataset to 2021 and re-evaluates the models. Using the same SEER data from 1975-2021, it identifies ARIMA (0,2,2), SES ($\alpha=0.999$), and HDES ($\alpha=0.5221$, $\beta=0.5219$) as the best-fitting models. Interestingly, ARIMA (0,2,2) and HDES yield the lowest RMSE of 2.56. To obtain forecasts with higher accuracy, an average model (HDES-ARIMA) consisting of HDES and ARIMA was constructed to leverage their strengths. The HDES-ARIMA model also achieves an RMSE of 2.56. The forecast from the average model suggests declining lung cancer mortality rates in the United States. The study highlights how expanding datasets and re-evaluating models can provide updated insights. It recommends further analysis using monthly data separated by gender, ethnicity, and state to understand lung cancer mortality dynamics in the United States. Overall, advanced time series methods like HDES and ARIMA show strong potential for accurately forecasting this major public health issue.</p></details> |  |

To address these challenges, we propose FlowletFormer, a BERT-based pre-training model specifically designed for network traffic analysis. FlowletFormer introduces a Coherent Behavior-Aware Traffic Representation Model for segmenting traffic into semantically meaningful units, a Protocol Stack Alignment-Based Embedding Layer to capture multilayer protocol semantics, and Field-Specific and Context-Aware Pretraining Tasks to enhance both inter-packet and inter-flow learning. Experimental results demonstrate that FlowletFormer significantly outperforms existing methods in the effectiveness of traffic representation, classification accuracy, and few-shot learning capability. Moreover, by effectively integrating domain-specific network knowledge, FlowletFormer shows better comprehension of the principles of network transmission (e.g., stateful connections of TCP), providing a more robust and trustworthy framework for traffic analysis.</p></details> |  |

This comprehensive review investigates traffic datasets and simulators as dual pillars supporting autonomous vehicle (AV) development. Unlike prior surveys that examine these resources independently, we present an integrated analysis spanning the entire AV pipeline-perception, localization, prediction, planning, and control. We evaluate annotation practices and quality metrics while examining how geographic diversity and environmental conditions affect system reliability. Our analysis includes detailed characterizations of datasets organized by functional domains and an in-depth examination of traffic simulators categorized by their specialized contributions to research and development. The paper explores emerging trends, including novel architecture frameworks, multimodal AI integration, and advanced data generation techniques that address critical edge cases.

| **[FlowDet: Overcoming Perspective and Scale Challenges in Real-Time End-to-End Traffic Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19565v1)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>End-to-end object detectors offer a promising NMS-free paradigm for real-time applications, yet their high computational cost remains a significant barrier, particularly for complex scenarios like intersection traffic monitoring. To address this challenge, we propose FlowDet, a high-speed detector featuring a decoupled encoder optimization strategy applied to the DETR architecture. Specifically, FlowDet employs a novel Geometric Deformable Unit (GDU) for traffic-aware geometric modeling and a Scale-Aware Attention (SAA) module to maintain high representational power across extreme scale variations. To rigorously evaluate the model's performance in environments with severe occlusion and high object density, we collected the Intersection-Flow-5k dataset, a new challenging scene for this task. Evaluated on Intersection-Flow-5k, FlowDet establishes a new state-of-the-art. Compared to the strong RT-DETR baseline, it improves AP(test) by 1.5% and AP50(test) by 1.6%, while simultaneously reducing GFLOPs by 63.2% and increasing inference speed by 16.2%. Our work demonstrates a new path towards building highly efficient and accurate detectors for demanding, real-world perception systems.

| **[DETNO: A Diffusion-Enhanced Transformer Neural Operator for Long-Term Traffic Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19389v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate long-term traffic forecasting remains a critical challenge in intelligent transportation systems, particularly when predicting high-frequency traffic phenomena such as shock waves and congestion boundaries over extended rollout horizons. Neural operators have recently gained attention as promising tools for modeling traffic flow. While effective at learning function space mappings, they inherently produce smooth predictions that fail to reconstruct high-frequency features such as sharp density gradients which results in rapid error accumulation during multi-step rollout predictions essential for real-time traffic management. To address these fundamental limitations, we introduce a unified Diffusion-Enhanced Transformer Neural Operator (DETNO) architecture. DETNO leverages a transformer neural operator with cross-attention mechanisms, providing model expressivity and super-resolution, coupled with a diffusion-based refinement component that iteratively reconstructs high-frequency traffic details through progressive denoising. This overcomes the inherent smoothing limitations and rollout instability of standard neural operators. Through comprehensive evaluation on chaotic traffic datasets, our method demonstrates superior performance in extended rollout predictions compared to traditional and transformer-based neural operators, preserving high-frequency components and improving stability over long prediction horizons.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimizing Highway Traffic Flow in Mixed Autonomy: A Multiagent Truncated Rollout Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19203v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The development of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) offers substantial opportunities to enhance traffic efficiency. However, in mixed autonomy environments where CAVs coexist with human-driven vehicles (HDVs), achieving efficient coordination among CAVs remains challenging due to heterogeneous driving behaviors. To address this, this paper proposes a multiagent truncated rollout approach that enhances CAV speed coordination to improve highway throughput while reducing computational overhead. In this approach, a traffic density evolution equation is formulated that comprehensively accounts for the presence or absence of CAVs, and a distributed coordination control framework is established accordingly. By incorporating kinematic information from neighbor agents and employing an agent-by-agent sequential solution mechanism, our method enables explicit cooperation among CAVs. Furthermore, we introduce a truncated rollout scheme that adaptively shortens the optimization horizon based on the evaluation of control sequences. This significantly reduces the time complexity, thereby improving real-time performance and scalability. Theoretical analysis provides rigorous guarantees on the stability and performance improvement of the system. Simulations conducted on real-world bottleneck scenarios demonstrate that, in large-scale mixed traffic flows, the proposed method outperforms conventional model predictive control methods by reducing both the average travel time in the bottleneck area and overall computational time, highlighting its strong potential for practical deployment.</p></details> |  |

However, the implementation of these allocation algorithms has not yet been covered by the standards. Our work focuses on deadline-guaranteeing resource allocation for networks with static and dynamic traffic. To achieve this, we combine offline network optimization heuristics with online admission control and, thus, allow for new flow registrations while the network is running. We demonstrate our solution on Credit-Based Shaper networks by using the delay analysis framework Network Calculus. We compare our approach with an intuitive and a brute-force algorithm, where we can achieve significant improvements, both, in terms of quality and runtime. Thereby, our results show that we can guarantee maximum end-to-end delays and also increase the flexibility of the network while requiring only minimal user input.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code published as DYRECTsn (https://github.com/Kathess/DYRECTsn): an open-source TSN framework for dynamic traffic with latency guarantees.

| **[SocialTrack: Multi-Object Tracking in Complex Urban Traffic Scenes Inspired by Social Behavior](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12777v2)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As a key research direction in the field of multi-object tracking (MOT), UAV-based multi-object tracking has significant application value in the analysis and understanding of urban intelligent transportation systems. However, in complex UAV perspectives, challenges such as small target scale variations, occlusions, nonlinear crossing motions, and motion blur severely hinder the stability of multi-object tracking. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel multi-object tracking framework, SocialTrack, aimed at enhancing the tracking accuracy and robustness of small targets in complex urban traffic environments. The specialized small-target detector enhances the detection performance by employing a multi-scale feature enhancement mechanism. The Velocity Adaptive Cubature Kalman Filter (VACKF) improves the accuracy of trajectory prediction by incorporating a velocity dynamic modeling mechanism. The Group Motion Compensation Strategy (GMCS) models social group motion priors to provide stable state update references for low-quality tracks, significantly improving the target association accuracy in complex dynamic environments. Furthermore, the Spatio-Temporal Memory Prediction (STMP) leverages historical trajectory information to predict the future state of low-quality tracks, effectively mitigating identity switching issues. Extensive experiments on the UAVDT and MOT17 datasets demonstrate that SocialTrack outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods across several key metrics. Significant improvements in MOTA and IDF1, among other core performance indicators, highlight its superior robustness and adaptability. Additionally, SocialTrack is highly modular and compatible, allowing for seamless integration with existing trackers to further enhance performance.</p></details> |  |

| **[Real-time Traffic Simulation and Management for Large-scale Urban Air Mobility: Integrating Route Guidance and Collision Avoidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01235v2)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Given the spatial heterogeneity of land use patterns in most cities, large-scale UAM deployments will likely focus on specific areas, such as intertransfer traffic between suburbs and city centers. However, large-scale UAM operations connecting multiple origin-destination pairs raise concerns about air traffic safety and efficiency due to potential conflict movements, particularly at major conflict points analogous to roadway junctions. To meet the safety and efficiency requirements of future UAM operations, this work proposes an air traffic management framework that integrates route guidance and collision avoidance. The route guidance mechanism optimizes aircraft distribution across both spatial and temporal dimensions by regulating their paths (composed of waypoints). Given the optimized paths, the collision avoidance algorithm generates collision-free aircraft trajectories between waypoints in the 3D space. To enable large-scale applications, we develop fast approximation methods for centralized path planning and adopt the velocity obstacle model for distributed collision avoidance. To our knowledge, this work is one of the first to integrate route guidance and collision avoidance for UAM. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework enables efficient and flexible UAM operations, including air traffic assignment, local congestion mitigation, and dynamic no-fly zone management. Compared with a collision-free baseline strategy, the proposed framework achieves considerable improvements in traffic safety and efficiency, with increases in the average minimum separation (+98.2%), the average travel speed (+70.2%), and the trip completion rate (+130%), along with a reduction in the energy consumption (-23.0%).

Because most road users are human drivers, reproducing their diverse behaviors within simulators is vital. Existing solutions, however, typically rely on either handcrafted heuristics or narrow data-driven models, which capture only fragments of real driving behaviors and offer limited driving style diversity and interpretability. To address this gap, we introduce HDSim, an HD traffic generation framework that combines cognitive theory with large language model (LLM) assistance to produce scalable and realistic traffic scenarios within simulation platforms. The framework advances the state of the art in two ways: (i) it introduces a hierarchical driver model that represents diverse driving style traits, and (ii) it develops a Perception-Mediated Behavior Influence strategy, where LLMs guide perception to indirectly shape driver actions. Experiments reveal that embedding HDSim into simulation improves detection of safety-critical failures in self-driving systems by up to 68% and yields realism-consistent accident interpretability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cyber Orbits of Large Scale Network Traffic](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16847v1)** | 2025-08-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The advent of high-performance graph libraries, such as the GraphBLAS, has enabled the analysis of massive network data sets and revealed new models for their behavior. Physical analogies for complicated network behavior can be a useful aid to understanding these newly discovered network phenomena. Prior work leveraged the canonical Gull's Lighthouse problem and developed a computational heuristic for modeling large scale network traffic using this model. A general solution using this approach requires overcoming the essential mathematical singularities in the resulting differential equations. Further investigation reveals a simpler physical interpretation that alleviates the need for solving challenging differential equations. Specifically, that the probability of observing a source at a temporal ``distance'' $r(t)$ at time $t$ is $p(t) \propto 1/r(t)^2$. This analogy aligns with many physical phenomena and can be a rich source of intuition. Applying this physical analogy to the observed source correlations in the Anonymized Network Sensing Graph Challenge data leads to an elegant cyber orbit analogy that may assist with the understanding network behavior.</p></details> | <details><summary>2 pag...</summary><p>2 pages, 1 figure, 10 reference, to appear at IEEE HPEC 2025</p></details> |
| **[Highly Accurate and Diverse Traffic Data: The DeepScenario Open 3D Dataset](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17371v3)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate 3D trajectory data is crucial for advancing autonomous driving. Yet, traditional datasets are usually captured by fixed sensors mounted on a car and are susceptible to occlusion. Additionally, such an approach can precisely reconstruct the dynamic environment in the close vicinity of the measurement vehicle only, while neglecting objects that are further away. In this paper, we introduce the DeepScenario Open 3D Dataset (DSC3D), a high-quality, occlusion-free dataset of 6 degrees of freedom bounding box trajectories acquired through a novel monocular camera drone tracking pipeline. Our dataset includes more than 175,000 trajectories of 14 types of traffic participants and significantly exceeds existing datasets in terms of diversity and scale, containing many unprecedented scenarios such as complex vehicle-pedestrian interaction on highly populated urban streets and comprehensive parking maneuvers from entry to exit. DSC3D dataset was captured in five various locations in Europe and the United States and include: a parking lot, a crowded inner-city, a steep urban intersection, a federal highway, and a suburban intersection. Our 3D trajectory dataset aims to enhance autonomous driving systems by providing detailed environmental 3D representations, which could lead to improved obstacle interactions and safety. We demonstrate its utility across multiple applications including motion prediction, motion planning, scenario mining, and generative reactive traffic agents. Our interactive online visualization platform and the complete dataset are publicly available at https://app.deepscenario.com, facilitating research in motion prediction, behavior modeling, and safety validation.</p></details> |  |

In particular, as a powerful evolutionary machine learning approach, Genetic Programming (GP) is utilized to evolve human-understandable phase urgency functions to measure the urgency of activating a green light for a specific phase. However, current GP-based methods are unable to treat the common traffic features of different traffic signal phases consistently. To address this issue, we propose to use a symmetric phase urgency function to calculate the phase urgency for a specific phase based on the current road conditions. This is represented as an aggregation of two shared subtrees, each representing the urgency of a turn movement in the phase. We then propose a GP method to evolve the symmetric phase urgency function. We evaluate our proposed method on the well-known cityflow traffic simulator, based on multiple public real-world datasets. The experimental results show that the proposed symmetric urgency function representation can significantly improve the performance of the learned traffic signal control policies over the traditional GP representation on a wide range of scenarios. Further analysis shows that the proposed method can evolve effective, human-understandable and easily deployable traffic signal control policies.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents a novel deep learning model, the Spatial-Temporal Unified Graph Attention Network (STGAtt). By leveraging a unified graph representation and an attention mechanism, STGAtt effectively captures complex spatial-temporal dependencies. Unlike methods relying on separate spatial and temporal dependency modeling modules, STGAtt directly models correlations within a Spatial-Temporal Unified Graph, dynamically weighing connections across both dimensions. To further enhance its capabilities, STGAtt partitions traffic flow observation signal into neighborhood subsets and employs a novel exchanging mechanism, enabling effective capture of both short-range and long-range correlations. Extensive experiments on the PEMS-BAY and SHMetro datasets demonstrate STGAtt's superior performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines across various prediction horizons. Visualization of attention weights confirms STGAtt's ability to adapt to dynamic traffic patterns and capture long-range dependencies, highlighting its potential for real-world traffic flow forecasting applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[A CASP-based Solution for Traffic Signal Optimisation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19061v2)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the context of urban traffic control, traffic signal optimisation is the problem of determining the optimal green length for each signal in a set of traffic signals. The literature has effectively tackled such a problem, mostly with automated planning techniques leveraging the PDDL+ language and solvers. However, such language has limitations when it comes to specifying optimisation statements and computing optimal plans. In this paper, we provide an alternative solution to the traffic signal optimisation problem based on Constraint Answer Set Programming (CASP). We devise an encoding in a CASP language, which is then solved by means of clingcon 3, a system extending the well-known ASP solver clingo. We performed experiments on real historical data from the town of Huddersfield in the UK, comparing our approach to the PDDL+ model that obtained the best results for the considered benchmark. The results showed the potential of our approach for tackling the traffic signal optimisation problem and improving the solution quality of the PDDL+ plans.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming (TPLP), Proceedings of ICLP 2025</p></details> |
| **[The Digital Life of Parisian Parks: Multifunctionality and Urban Context Uncovered by Mobile Application Traffic](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15516v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Landscape architecture typically considers urban parks through the lens of form and function. While past research on equitable access has focused mainly on form, studies of functions have been constrained by limited scale and coarse measurement. Existing efforts have partially quantified functions through small-scale surveys and movement data (e.g., GPS) or general usage records (e.g., CDR), but have not captured the activities and motivations underlying park visits. As a result, our understanding of the functional roles urban parks play remains incomplete. To address this gap, we introduce a method that refines mobile base station coverage using antenna azimuths, enabling clearer distinction of mobile traffic within parks versus surrounding areas. Using Paris as a case study, we analyze a large-scale set of passively collected per-app mobile network traffic - 492 million hourly records for 45 parks. We test two hypotheses: the central-city hypothesis, which posits multifunctional parks emerge in dense, high-rent areas due to land scarcity; and the socio-spatial hypothesis, which views parks as reflections of neighborhood routines and preferences. Our analysis shows that parks have distinctive mobile traffic signatures, differing from both their surroundings and from each other. By clustering parks on temporal and app usage patterns, we identify three functional types - lunchbreak, cultural, and recreational - with different visitation motivations. Centrally located parks (cultural and lunchbreak) display more diverse app use and temporal variation, while suburban (recreational) parks reflect digital behaviors of nearby communities, with app preferences aligned to neighborhood income. These findings demonstrate the value of mobile traffic as a proxy for studying urban green space functions, with implications for park planning, public health, and well-being.</p></details> |  |

Lightweight models like MobileNet and EfficientNet, which utilize depthwise convolution for feature extraction, have been developed for these devices. However, CIM macros often face challenges in accelerating depthwise convolution, including underutilization of CIM memory and heavy buffer traffic. The latter, in particular, has been overlooked despite its significant impact on latency and energy consumption. To address this, we introduce a novel CIM dataflow that significantly reduces buffer traffic by maximizing data reuse and improving memory utilization during depthwise convolution. The proposed dataflow is grounded in solid theoretical principles, fully demonstrated in this paper. When applied to MobileNet and EfficientNet models, our dataflow reduces buffer traffic by 77.4-87.0%, leading to a total reduction in data traffic energy and latency by 10.1-17.9% and 15.6-27.8%, respectively, compared to the baseline (conventional weight-stationary dataflow).</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE International Conference on Computer Design</p></details> |

Adaptive routing faces two main challenges: 1) how to accurately measure/estimate time-varying traffic matrices? 2) how to control the network and application performance degradation caused by frequent route changes? In this paper, we develop a novel data-enabled predictive traffic engineering (DeeP-TE) algorithm that minimizes the network congestion by gracefully adapting routing configurations over time. Our control algorithm can generate routing updates directly from the historical routing data and the corresponding link rate data, without direct traffic matrix measurement or estimation. Numerical experiments on real network topologies with real traffic matrices demonstrate that the proposed DeeP-TE routing adaptation algorithm can achieve close-to-optimal control effectiveness with significantly lower routing variations than the baseline methods.</p></details> |  |

Traditional approaches often struggle with scalability and generalization, particularly under the complex and dynamic conditions of real-world environments. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel structured prompting and knowledge distillation framework that enables automatic generation of high-quality traffic scene annotations and contextual risk assessments. Our framework orchestrates two large Vision-Language Models (VLMs): GPT-4o and o3-mini, using a structured Chain-of-Thought (CoT) strategy to produce rich, multi-perspective outputs. These outputs serve as knowledge-enriched pseudo-annotations for supervised fine-tuning of a much smaller student VLM. The resulting compact 3B-scale model, named VISTA (Vision for Intelligent Scene and Traffic Analysis), is capable of understanding low-resolution traffic videos and generating semantically faithful, risk-aware captions. Despite its significantly reduced parameter count, VISTA achieves strong performance across established captioning metrics (BLEU-4, METEOR, ROUGE-L, and CIDEr) when benchmarked against its teacher models. This demonstrates that effective knowledge distillation and structured multi-agent supervision can empower lightweight VLMs to capture complex reasoning capabilities. The compact architecture of VISTA facilitates efficient deployment on edge devices, enabling real-time risk monitoring without requiring extensive infrastructure upgrades.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 10 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

Although Transformer-based models offer strong global modeling, they often struggle with rigid temporal encoding and weak space-time fusion. We propose STPFormer, a Spatio-Temporal Pattern-Aware Transformer that achieves state-of-the-art performance via unified and interpretable representation learning. It integrates four modules: Temporal Position Aggregator (TPA) for pattern-aware temporal encoding, Spatial Sequence Aggregator (SSA) for sequential spatial learning, Spatial-Temporal Graph Matching (STGM) for cross-domain alignment, and an Attention Mixer for multi-scale fusion. Experiments on five real-world datasets show that STPFormer consistently sets new SOTA results, with ablation and visualizations confirming its effectiveness and generalizability.</p></details> |  |

This study presents a decentralized, federated learning framework tailored for traffic sign detection in vehicular networks to enable collaborative model training without sharing raw data. The framework partitioned traffic sign classes across vehicles for specialized local training using lightweight object detectors, aggregated model parameters via algorithms like FedProx, FedAdam and FedAVG in a simulated environment with the Flower framework, and evaluated multiple configurations including varying server rounds, local epochs, client participation fractions, and data distributions. Experiments demonstrated that increasing server rounds from 2 to 20 boosted accuracy from below 0.1 to over 0.8, moderate local epochs (8-10) provided optimal efficiency with accuracies around 0.67, higher client participation fractions enhanced generalization up to 0.83, FedProx outperformed other aggregators in handling heterogeneity, non-IID data distributions reduced performance compared to IID, and training duration primarily scaled with the number of rounds rather than aggregation strategy. We conclude that this federated approach may offer a scalable, privacy-preserving solution for real-world vehicular deployments, potentially guiding future integrations of robust aggregation and communication optimizations to advance intelligent transportation systems.</p></details> | 7 pages, 10 figures |
| **[RIFT: Closed-Loop RL Fine-Tuning for Realistic and Controllable Traffic Simulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03344v2)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Achieving both realism and controllability in closed-loop traffic simulation remains a key challenge in autonomous driving. Dataset-based methods reproduce realistic trajectories but suffer from covariate shift in closed-loop deployment, compounded by simplified dynamics models that further reduce reliability. Conversely, physics-based simulation methods enhance reliable and controllable closed-loop interactions but often lack expert demonstrations, compromising realism. To address these challenges, we introduce a dual-stage AV-centric simulation framework that conducts open-loop imitation learning pre-training in a data-driven simulator to capture trajectory-level realism and route-level controllability, followed by closed-loop reinforcement learning fine-tuning in a physics-based simulator to enhance style-level controllability and mitigate covariate shift. In the fine-tuning stage, we propose RIFT, a novel RL fine-tuning strategy that evaluates all candidate modalities through group-relative optimization with a dual-clip surrogate objective, enhancing style-level controllability and mitigating covariate shift, while preserving the trajectory-level realism and route-level controllability inherited from IL pre-training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RIFT improves realism and controllability in traffic simulation while simultaneously exposing the limitations of modern AV systems in closed-loop evaluation.

While Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) enforce PDE constraints point-wise, this paper adopts a physics-informed deep operator network (PI-DeepONet) framework that reformulates TSE as an operator learning problem. Our approach trains a parameterized neural operator that maps sparse input data to the full spatiotemporal traffic state field, governed by the traffic flow conservation law. Crucially, unlike PINNs that enforce PDE constraints point-wise, PI-DeepONet integrates traffic flow conservation model and the fundamental diagram directly into the operator learning process, ensuring physical consistency while capturing congestion propagation, spatial correlations, and temporal evolution. Experiments on the NGSIM dataset demonstrate superior performance over state-of-the-art baselines. Further analysis reveals insights into optimal function generation strategies and branch network complexity. Additionally, the impact of input function generation methods and the number of functions on model performance is explored, highlighting the robustness and efficacy of proposed framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>under...</summary><p>under review in Transportmetrica B: Transport Dynamics</p></details> |

Observing unsolicited and erroneous traffic, such as unanswered traffic or errors, is fundamental to detect misconfiguration, temporary failures or attacks. ChamaleoNet transforms any production network into a transparent monitor to let administrators collect unsolicited and erroneous traffic directed to hosts, whether offline or active, hosting a server or a client, protected by a firewall, or unused addresses. ChamaleoNet is programmed to ignore well-formed traffic and collect only erroneous packets, including those generated by misconfigured or infected internal hosts, and those sent by external actors which scan for services. Engineering such a system poses several challenges, from scalability to privacy. Leveraging the SDN paradigm, ChamaleoNet processes the traffic flowing through a campus/corporate network and focuses on erroneous packets only, lowering the pressure on the collection system while respecting privacy regulations by design. ChamaleoNet enables the seamless integration with active deceptive systems like honeypots that can impersonate unused hosts/ports/services and engage with senders. The SDN in-hardware filtering reduces the traffic to the controller by 96%, resulting in a scalable solution, which we offer as open source. Simple analytics unveil internal misconfigured and infected hosts, identify temporary failures, and enhance visibility on external radiation produced by attackers looking for vulnerable services.</p></details> | 17 pages, 16 figures |

However, existing MLLMs in this domain primarily focus on coarse-grained image-level or video-level comprehension and often struggle to handle fine-grained visual details or localized scene components, limiting their applicability in complex accident scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose SafePLUG, a novel framework that empowers MLLMs with both Pixel-Level Understanding and temporal Grounding for comprehensive traffic accident analysis. SafePLUG supports both arbitrary-shaped visual prompts for region-aware question answering and pixel-level segmentation based on language instructions, while also enabling the recognition of temporally anchored events in traffic accident scenarios. To advance the development of MLLMs for traffic accident understanding, we curate a new dataset containing multimodal question-answer pairs centered on diverse accident scenarios, with detailed pixel-level annotations and temporal event boundaries. Experimental results show that SafePLUG achieves strong performance on multiple tasks, including region-based question answering, pixel-level segmentation, temporal event localization, and accident event understanding. These capabilities lay a foundation for fine-grained understanding of complex traffic scenes, with the potential to improve driving safety and enhance situational awareness in smart transportation systems.

As the number of signals increases, coordination becomes more challenging and traditional progression schemes tend to break down. Long progressions save travel time and fuel, reduce pollution and traffic accidents by providing a smoother flow of traffic. This paper introduces a green-wave theory that can be applied to a network of intersecting arterial roads. It enables uninterrupted flow on arbitrary long signalized arterials using a Road-to-Traveler-Feedback Device. The approach is modelled after Euclid. We define concepts such as RGW-roads (roads where vehicles traveling at the recommended speed make all traffic signals), green-arrows (representing vehicle platoons), real nodes (representing signalized intersections where RGW-roads intersect) and virtual nodes, green-wave speed, blocks, etc. - the analogue of Euclid's postulates. We then use geometric reasoning to deduce results: green-arrow lengths have a maximum value, are restricted to discrete lengths, and green-arrow laws of motion imply that select existing arterial roads can be converted to RGW-roads. The signal timings and offsets that are produced have been shown to be effective using a simulation model developed previously called RGW-SIM.</p></details> | 74 pages, 49 figures |
| **[Scale-Disentangled spatiotemporal Modeling for Long-term Traffic Emission Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11923v1)** | 2025-08-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long-term traffic emission forecasting is crucial for the comprehensive management of urban air pollution. Traditional forecasting methods typically construct spatiotemporal graph models by mining spatiotemporal dependencies to predict emissions. However, due to the multi-scale entanglement of traffic emissions across time and space, these spatiotemporal graph modeling method tend to suffer from cascading error amplification during long-term inference. To address this issue, we propose a Scale-Disentangled Spatio-Temporal Modeling (SDSTM) framework for long-term traffic emission forecasting. It leverages the predictability differences across multiple scales to decompose and fuse features at different scales, while constraining them to remain independent yet complementary. Specifically, the model first introduces a dual-stream feature decomposition strategy based on the Koopman lifting operator. It lifts the scale-coupled spatiotemporal dynamical system into an infinite-dimensional linear space via Koopman operator, and delineates the predictability boundary using gated wavelet decomposition. Then a novel fusion mechanism is constructed, incorporating a dual-stream independence constraint based on cross-term loss to dynamically refine the dual-stream prediction results, suppress mutual interference, and enhance the accuracy of long-term traffic emission prediction. Extensive experiments conducted on a road-level traffic emission dataset within Xi'an's Second Ring Road demonstrate that the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |

This study introduces a curated dataset of more than 3 million people involved in accidents in Ohio over six years (2017-2022), aggregated to more than 2.3 million vehicle-level records for predictive analysis. The primary contribution is a transparent and reproducible methodology that combines Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) and explainable artificial intelligence (AI) to identify and interpret key risk factors associated with severe crashes. Using the JADBio AutoML platform, predictive models were constructed to distinguish between severe and non-severe crash outcomes. The models underwent rigorous feature selection across stratified training subsets, and their outputs were interpreted using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to quantify the contribution of individual features. A final Ridge Logistic Regression model achieved an AUC-ROC of 85.6% on the training set and 84.9% on a hold-out test set, with 17 features consistently identified as the most influential predictors. Key features spanned demographic, environmental, vehicle, human, and operational categories, including location type, posted speed, minimum occupant age, and pre-crash action. Notably, certain traditionally emphasized factors, such as alcohol or drug impairment, were less influential in the final model compared to environmental and contextual variables. Emphasizing methodological rigor and interpretability over mere predictive performance, this study offers a scalable framework to support Vision Zero with aligned interventions and advanced data-informed traffic safety policy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

To address this, we introduce a novel, end-to-end approach, $\texttt{AirTrafficGen}$, that leverages large language models (LLMs) to automate and control the generation of complex ATC scenarios. Our method uses a purpose-built, graph-based representation to encode sector topology (including airspace geometry, routes, and fixes) into a format LLMs can process. Through rigorous benchmarking, we show that state-of-the-art models like Gemini 2.5 Pro, OpenAI o3, GPT-oss-120b and GPT-5 can generate high-traffic scenarios while maintaining operational realism. Our engineered prompting enables fine-grained control over interaction presence, type, and location. Initial findings suggest these models are also capable of iterative refinement, correcting flawed scenarios based on simple textual feedback. This approach provides a scalable alternative to manual scenario design, addressing the need for a greater volume and variety of ATC training and validation simulations. More broadly, this work showcases the potential of LLMs for complex planning in safety-critical domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages and appendices</p></details> |

However, the realism of a simulation depends extensively on the quality of input data. This paper presents an intersection traffic simulation tool that leverages real-world vehicle turning movement count (TMC) data from the City of Toronto to model traffic in an urban environment at an individual or multiple intersections using Simulation of Urban MObility (SUMO). The simulation performed in this research focuses specifically on intersection-level traffic generation without creating full vehicle routes through the network. This also helps keep the network's complexity to a minimum. The simulated traffic is evaluated against actual data to show that the simulation closely reproduces real intersection flows. This validates that the real data can drive practical simulations, and these scenarios can replace synthetic or random generated data, which is prominently used in developing new traffic-related methodologies. This is the first tool to integrate TMC data from Toronto into SUMO via an easy-to-use Graphical User Interface.

| **[Beyond conventional vision: RGB-event fusion for robust object detection in dynamic traffic scenarios](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10704v1)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The dynamic range limitation of conventional RGB cameras reduces global contrast and causes loss of high-frequency details such as textures and edges in complex traffic environments (e.g., nighttime driving, tunnels), hindering discriminative feature extraction and degrading frame-based object detection. To address this, we integrate a bio-inspired event camera with an RGB camera to provide high dynamic range information and propose a motion cue fusion network (MCFNet), which achieves optimal spatiotemporal alignment and adaptive cross-modal feature fusion under challenging lighting. Specifically, an event correction module (ECM) temporally aligns asynchronous event streams with image frames via optical-flow-based warping, jointly optimized with the detection network to learn task-aware event representations. The event dynamic upsampling module (EDUM) enhances spatial resolution of event frames to match image structures, ensuring precise spatiotemporal alignment. The cross-modal mamba fusion module (CMM) uses adaptive feature fusion with a novel interlaced scanning mechanism, effectively integrating complementary information for robust detection. Experiments conducted on the DSEC-Det and PKU-DAVIS-SOD datasets demonstrate that MCFNet significantly outperforms existing methods in various poor lighting and fast moving traffic scenarios. Notably, on the DSEC-Det dataset, MCFNet achieves a remarkable improvement, surpassing the best existing methods by 7.4% in mAP50 and 1.7% in mAP metrics, respectively. The code is available at https://github.com/Charm11492/MCFNet.</p></details> |  |
| **[Gaze-Based Indicators of Driver Cognitive Distraction: Effects of Different Traffic Conditions and Adaptive Cruise Control Use](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10624v1)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this simulator study, we investigate how gaze parameters reflect driver cognitive distraction under varying traffic conditions and adaptive cruise control (ACC) use. Participants completed six driving scenarios that combined two levels of cognitive distraction (with/without mental calculations) and three levels of driving environment complexity. Throughout the experiment, participants were free to activate or deactivate an ACC. We analyzed two gaze-based indicators of driver cognitive distraction: the percent road center, and the gaze dispersions (horizontal and vertical). Our results show that vertical gaze dispersion increases with traffic complexity, while ACC use leads to gaze concentration toward the road center. Cognitive distraction reduces road center gaze and increases vertical dispersion. Complementary analyses revealed that these observations actually arise mainly between mental calculations, while periods of mental calculations are characterized by a temporary increase in gaze concentration.</p></details> |  |

Participants drove in six scenarios, combining two levels of cognitive distraction (presence/absence of a mental calculation task) and three levels of driving environment complexity (different traffic conditions). Throughout the experiment, they were free to activate or deactivate ACC (ACC use, two levels). We analyzed three EDA-based indicators of cognitive distraction: SCL (mean skin conductance level), SCR amplitude (mean amplitude of skin conductance responses), and SCR rate (rate of skin conductance responses). Results indicate that all three indicators were significantly influenced by cognitive distraction and ACC use, while environment complexity influenced SCL and SCR amplitude, but not SCR rate. These findings suggest that EDA-based indicators reflect variations in drivers' mental workload due not only to cognitive distraction, but also to driving environment and automation use.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Retrieval Augmented Spatio-Temporal Framework for Traffic Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16623v1)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic prediction is a cornerstone of modern intelligent transportation systems and a critical task in spatio-temporal forecasting. Although advanced Spatio-temporal Graph Neural Networks (STGNNs) and pre-trained models have achieved significant progress in traffic prediction, two key challenges remain: (i) limited contextual capacity when modeling complex spatio-temporal dependencies, and (ii) low predictability at fine-grained spatio-temporal points due to heterogeneous patterns. Inspired by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), we propose RAST, a universal framework that integrates retrieval-augmented mechanisms with spatio-temporal modeling to address these challenges. Our framework consists of three key designs: 1) Decoupled Encoder and Query Generator to capture decoupled spatial and temporal features and construct a fusion query via residual fusion; 2) Spatio-temporal Retrieval Store and Retrievers to maintain and retrieve vectorized fine-grained patterns; and 3) Universal Backbone Predictor that flexibly accommodates pre-trained STGNNs or simple MLP predictors. Extensive experiments on six real-world traffic networks, including large-scale datasets, demonstrate that RAST achieves superior performance while maintaining computational efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[M3-Net: A Cost-Effective Graph-Free MLP-Based Model for Traffic Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08543v2)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Achieving accurate traffic prediction is a fundamental but crucial task in the development of current intelligent transportation systems.Most of the mainstream methods that have made breakthroughs in traffic prediction rely on spatio-temporal graph neural networks, spatio-temporal attention mechanisms, etc. The main challenges of the existing deep learning approaches are that they either depend on a complete traffic network structure or require intricate model designs to capture complex spatio-temporal dependencies. These limitations pose significant challenges for the efficient deployment and operation of deep learning models on large-scale datasets. To address these challenges, we propose a cost-effective graph-free Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) based model M3-Net for traffic prediction. Our proposed model not only employs time series and spatio-temporal embeddings for efficient feature processing but also first introduces a novel MLP-Mixer architecture with a mixture of experts (MoE) mechanism. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple real datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model in terms of prediction performance and lightweight deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Metering traffic flows for perimeter control through auction-based signalling using connected vehicles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09678v1)** | 2025-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Urban traffic congestion remains a critical challenge in modern cities, with traffic signal control systems often struggling to manage congestion during peak travel times. Perimeter control of a Protected Network (PN) has emerged as a potential solution to reducing gridlock in urban networks. This paper proposes a novel auction-based mechanism for green time allocation at signalized intersections, for effective perimeter control application. Utilising a Sealed Bid, Second Price auction framework, our approach combines real-time traffic monitoring with market-inspired mechanisms to regulate vehicle inflows into PN areas. Unlike existing methods that focus primarily on gated links, our system allocates budgets to individual traffic movements, providing greater flexibility in managing multi-directional flows. We evaluate the proposed mechanism using a test case intersection with a single controlled inflow, comparing it against a volume-based fixed-time approach. The results demonstrate that our auction-based method controls flows into the PN with improved accuracy, outperforming the volume-based approach in terms of inflow regulation, queue management and delays. The framework can be applied in real time to any generic intersection, offering a scalable solution for urban traffic management. This work bridges the gap between perimeter control and market-based intersection auctions, providing a pathway for further research on adaptive traffic management systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluation of Bio-Inspired Models under Different Learning Settings For Energy Efficiency in Network Traffic Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17565v2)** | 2025-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cellular traffic forecasting is a critical task that enables network operators to efficiently allocate resources and address anomalies in rapidly evolving environments. The exponential growth of data collected from base stations poses significant challenges to processing and analysis. While machine learning (ML) algorithms have emerged as powerful tools for handling these large datasets and providing accurate predictions, their environmental impact, particularly in terms of energy consumption, is often overlooked in favor of their predictive capabilities. This study investigates the potential of two bio-inspired models: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) and Reservoir Computing through Echo State Networks (ESNs) for cellular traffic forecasting. The evaluation focuses on both their predictive performance and energy efficiency. These models are implemented in both centralized and federated settings to analyze their effectiveness and energy consumption in decentralized systems. Additionally, we compare bio-inspired models with traditional architectures, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), to provide a comprehensive evaluation. Using data collected from three diverse locations in Barcelona, Spain, we examine the trade-offs between predictive accuracy and energy demands across these approaches. The results indicate that bio-inspired models, such as SNNs and ESNs, can achieve significant energy savings while maintaining predictive accuracy comparable to traditional architectures. Furthermore, federated implementations were tested to evaluate their energy efficiency in decentralized settings compared to centralized systems, particularly in combination with bio-inspired models. These findings offer valuable insights into the potential of bio-inspired models for sustainable and privacy-preserving cellular traffic forecasting.</p></details> | 18 pages, 8 figures |

This study addresses binary VPN detection, distinguishing VPN-encrypted from non-VPN traffic using wavelet transform-based features across multiple machine learning models. Unlike previous studies focused on application-level classification within encrypted traffic, we specifically evaluate the fundamental task of VPN identification regardless of application type. We analyze the impact of wavelet decomposition levels and dataset filtering on classification performance across significantly imbalanced data, where filtering reduces some traffic categories by up to 95%. Our results demonstrate that Random Forest (RF) achieves superior performance with an F1-score of 99%, maintaining robust accuracy even after significant dataset filtering. Neural Networks (NN) show comparable effectiveness with an F1-score of 98% when trained on wavelet level 12, while Support Vector Machines (SVM) exhibit notable sensitivity to dataset reduction, with F1-scores dropping from 90% to 85% after filtering. Comparing wavelet decomposition at levels 5 and 12, we observe improved classification performance at level 12, particularly for variable traffic types, though the marginal gains may not justify the additional computational overhead. These findings establish RF as the most reliable model for VPN traffic classification while highlighting key performance tradeoffs in feature extraction and preprocessing.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for presentation at SoftCOM 2025</p></details> |

Focusing resources on the causes of congestion is a potentially efficient strategy for reducing slowdowns. We present NEXICA, an algorithm to discover which parts of the highway system tend to cause slowdowns on other parts of the highway. We use time series of road speeds as inputs to our causal discovery algorithm. Finding other algorithms inadequate, we develop a new approach that is novel in three ways. First, it concentrates on just the presence or absence of events in the time series, where an event indicates the temporal beginning of a traffic slowdown. Second, we develop a probabilistic model using maximum likelihood estimation to compute the probabilities of spontaneous and caused slowdowns between two locations on the highway. Third, we train a binary classifier to identify pairs of cause/effect locations trained on pairs of road locations where we are reasonably certain a priori of their causal connections, both positive and negative. We test our approach on six months of road speed data from 195 different highway speed sensors in the Los Angeles area, showing that our approach is superior to state-of-the-art baselines in both accuracy and computation speed.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extended version of short paper in 32nd ACM SIGSPATIAL International Conference on Advances in Geographic Information Systems (ACM SIGSPATIAL 2024)</p></details> |
| **[From Micro to Macro Flow Modeling: Characterizing Heterogeneity of Mixed-Autonomy Traffic](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09432v1)** | 2025-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most autonomous-vehicles (AVs) driving strategies are designed and analyzed at the vehicle level, yet their aggregate impact on macroscopic traffic flow is still not understood, particularly the flow heterogeneity that emerges when AVs interact with human-driven vehicles (HVs). Existing validation techniques for macroscopic flow models rely on high-resolution spatiotemporal data spanning entire road segments which are rarely available for mixed-autonomy traffic. AVs record detailed Lagrangian trajectories of the ego vehicle and surrounding traffic through onboard sensors. Leveraging these Lagrangian observations to validate mixed-autonomy flow models therefore remains an open research challenge. This paper closes the gap between microscopic Lagrangian data and macroscopic Euclidean traffic models by introducing a continuous traffic-heterogeneity attribute. We represent traffic flow with two coupled conservation laws with one for vehicle number and one for the traffic attribute. Reconstruction methods are designed to derive the traffic attribute from Lagrangian vehicle trajectories. When abundant trajectory data are available, we characterize traffic heterogeneity by extracting drivers' desired speed and local behavioral uncertainty from trajectories. In data-scarce mixed traffic, we design an end-to-end mapping that infers the traffic heterogeneity solely from trajectories in the current spatiotemporal region. Experiments across multiple traffic datasets show that the proposed model effectively captures traffic heterogeneity by clustering the fundamental diagram scatter into attribute-based groups. The calibration errors of traffic flow dynamics are also reduce by 20% relative to the Aw-Rascle-Zhang model benchmark. Detailed analyses further show that the model generalizes well, maintaining nearly the same accuracy when evaluated under a variety of previously unseen traffic conditions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Carbon Pricing in Traffic Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09280v1)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic is a significant source of global carbon emissions. In this paper, we study how carbon pricing can be used to guide traffic towards equilibria that respect given emission budgets. In particular, we consider a general multi-commodity flow model with flow-dependent externalities. These externalities may represent carbon emissions, entering a priced area, or the traversal of paths regulated by tradable credit schemes. We provide a complete characterization of all flows that can be attained as Wardrop equilibria when assigning a single price to each externality. More precisely, we show that every externality budget achievable by any feasible flow in the network can also be achieved as a Wardrop equilibrium by setting appropriate prices. For extremal and Pareto-minimal budgets, we show that there are prices such that all equilibria respect the budgets. Although the proofs of existence of these particular prices rely on fixed-point arguments and are non-constructive, we show that in the case where the equilibrium minimizes a convex potential, the prices can be obtained as Lagrange multipliers of a suitable convex program. In the case of a single externality, we prove that the total externality caused by the traffic flow is decreasing in the price. For increasing, continuous, and piecewise affine travel time functions with a single externality, we give an output-polynomial algorithm that computes all equilibria implementable by pricing the externality. Even though there are networks where the output size is exponential in the input size, we show that the minimal price obeying a given budget can be computed in polynomial time. This allows the efficient computation of the market price of tradable credit schemes. Overall, our results show that carbon pricing is a viable and (under mild assumptions) tractable approach to achieve all feasible emission goals in traffic networks.</p></details> | 29 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Generalising Traffic Forecasting to Regions without Traffic Observations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08947v1)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic forecasting is essential for intelligent transportation systems. Accurate forecasting relies on continuous observations collected by traffic sensors. However, due to high deployment and maintenance costs, not all regions are equipped with such sensors. This paper aims to forecast for regions without traffic sensors, where the lack of historical traffic observations challenges the generalisability of existing models. We propose a model named GenCast, the core idea of which is to exploit external knowledge to compensate for the missing observations and to enhance generalisation. We integrate physics-informed neural networks into GenCast, enabling physical principles to regularise the learning process. We introduce an external signal learning module to explore correlations between traffic states and external signals such as weather conditions, further improving model generalisability. Additionally, we design a spatial grouping module to filter localised features that hinder model generalisability. Extensive experiments show that GenCast consistently reduces forecasting errors on multiple real-world datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Safety Perspective on Assisted Lane Changes: Insights from Open-Road, Live-Traffic Experiments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09233v1)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study investigates the assisted lane change functionality of five different vehicles equipped with advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS). The goal is to examine novel, under-researched features of commercially available ADAS technologies. The experimental campaign, conducted in the I-24 highway near Nashville, TN, US, collected data on the kinematics and safety margins of assisted lane changes in real-world conditions. The results show that the kinematics of assisted lane changes are consistent for each system, with four out of five vehicles using slower speeds and decelerations than human drivers. However, one system consistently performed more assertive lane changes, completing the maneuver in around 5 seconds. Regarding safety margins, only three vehicles are investigated. Those operated in the US are not restricted by relevant UN regulations, and their designs were found not to adhere to these regulatory requirements. A simulation method used to classify the challenge level for the vehicle receiving the lane change, showing that these systems can force trailing vehicles to decelerate to keep a safe gap. One assisted system was found to have performed a maneuver that posed a hard challenge level for the other vehicle, raising concerns about the safety of these systems in real-world operation. All three vehicles were found to carry out lane changes that induced decelerations to the vehicle in the target lane. Those decelerations could affect traffic flow, inducing traffic shockwaves.</p></details> | 21 pages, 8 Figures |

The recent success of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) LLMs raises the question of how to deploy them efficiently, considering their underlying structure. During the inference in MoE LLMs, only a small part of the experts is selected to process a given token. Moreover, in practice, the experts' load is highly imbalanced. For efficient deployment, one has to distribute the model across a large number of servers using a model placement algorithm. Thus, to improve cluster utilization, the model placement algorithm has to take into account the network topology. This work focuses on the efficient topology-aware placement of the pre-trained MoE LLMs in the inference stage. We propose an integer linear program (ILP) that determines the optimal placement of experts, minimizing the expected number of transmissions. Due to the internal structure, this optimization problem can be solved with a standard ILP solver. We demonstrate that ILP-based placement strategy yields lower network traffic than competitors for small-scale (DeepSeekMoE~16B) and large-scale (DeepSeek-R1~671B) models.</p></details> |  |

However, jointly controlling both in real-time to alleviate traffic congestion presents new challenges, such as the inherent physical and behavioral heterogeneity between signal control and platooning, as well as coordination between them. This paper proposes an innovative solution to tackle these challenges based on heterogeneous graph multi-agent reinforcement learning and traffic theories. Our approach involves: 1) designing platoon and signal control as distinct reinforcement learning agents with their own set of observations, actions, and reward functions to optimize traffic flow; 2) designing coordination by incorporating graph neural networks within multi-agent reinforcement learning to facilitate seamless information exchange among agents on a regional scale; 3) applying alternating optimization for training, allowing agents to update their own policies and adapt to other agents' policies. We evaluate our approach through SUMO simulations, which show convergent results in terms of both travel time and fuel consumption, and superior performance compared to other adaptive signal control methods.</p></details> |  |

However, it encounters significant challenges including harsh communication environments, limited energy supply, and restricted signal transmission. This paper aims to provide efficient and reliable communication in underwater networks with limited energy and communication resources by optimizing the scheduling of communication links and adjusting transmission parameters (e.g., transmit power and transmission rate). The efficient and reliable communication multi-objective optimization problem (ERCMOP) is formulated as a decentralized partially observable Markov decision process (Dec-POMDP). A Traffic Load-Aware Resource Management (TARM) strategy based on deep multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is presented to address this problem. Specifically, a traffic load-aware mechanism that leverages the overhear information from neighboring nodes is designed to mitigate the disparity between partial observations and global states. Moreover, by incorporating a solution space optimization algorithm, the number of candidate solutions for the deep MARL-based decision-making model can be effectively reduced, thereby optimizing the computational complexity. Simulation results demonstrate the adaptability of TARM in various scenarios with different transmission demands and collision probabilities, while also validating the effectiveness of the proposed approach in supporting efficient and reliable communication in underwater networks with limited resources.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing</p></details> |

One crucial step is modeling the volume of traffic demand. But past demand modeling approaches have relied on unrealistic or suboptimal heuristics, and they have failed to adequately account for the effects of noisy and multimodal data on simulation outcomes. In this work, we integrate advances in AI to construct a three-step, end-to-end pipeline for systematically modeling traffic demand from detector data: computer vision for vehicle counting from noisy camera footage, combinatorial optimization for vehicle route generation from multimodal data, and large language models for iterative simulation refinement from natural language feedback. Using a road network from Strongsville, Ohio as a testbed, we show that our pipeline accurately captures the city's traffic patterns in a granular simulation. Beyond Strongsville, incorporating noise and multimodality makes our framework generalizable to municipalities with different levels of data and infrastructure availability.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages; 1 table; 6 figures; extended version of accepted version, published at the 2025 Winter Simulation Conference (WSC '25)</p></details> |
| **[A Physics-informed Deep Operator for Real-Time Freeway Traffic State Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08002v1)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic state estimation (TSE) falls methodologically into three categories: model-driven, data-driven, and model-data dual-driven. Model-driven TSE relies on macroscopic traffic flow models originated from hydrodynamics. Data-driven TSE leverages historical sensing data and employs statistical models or machine learning methods to infer traffic state. Model-data dual-driven traffic state estimation attempts to harness the strengths of both aspects to achieve more accurate TSE. From the perspective of mathematical operator theory, TSE can be viewed as a type of operator that maps available measurements of inerested traffic state into unmeasured traffic state variables in real time. For the first time this paper proposes to study real-time freeway TSE in the idea of physics-informed deep operator network (PI-DeepONet), which is an operator-oriented architecture embedding traffic flow models based on deep neural networks. The paper has developed an extended architecture from the original PI-DeepONet. The extended architecture is featured with: (1) the acceptance of 2-D data input so as to support CNN-based computations; (2) the introduction of a nonlinear expansion layer, an attention mechanism, and a MIMO mechanism; (3) dedicated neural network design for adaptive identification of traffic flow model parameters. A traffic state estimator built on the basis of this extended PI-DeepONet architecture was evaluated with respect to a short freeway stretch of NGSIM and a large-scale urban expressway in China, along with other four baseline TSE methods. The evaluation results demonstrated that this novel TSE method outperformed the baseline methods with high-precision estimation results of flow and mean speed.</p></details> | 18 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Noise-Aware Generative Microscopic Traffic Simulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07453v1)** | 2025-08-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately modeling individual vehicle behavior in microscopic traffic simulation remains a key challenge in intelligent transportation systems, as it requires vehicles to realistically generate and respond to complex traffic phenomena such as phantom traffic jams. While traditional human driver simulation models offer computational tractability, they do so by abstracting away the very complexity that defines human driving. On the other hand, recent advances in infrastructure-mounted camera-based roadway sensing have enabled the extraction of vehicle trajectory data, presenting an opportunity to shift toward generative, agent-based models. Yet, a major bottleneck remains: most existing datasets are either overly sanitized or lack standardization, failing to reflect the noisy, imperfect nature of real-world sensing. Unlike data from vehicle-mounted sensors-which can mitigate sensing artifacts like occlusion through overlapping fields of view and sensor fusion-infrastructure-based sensors surface a messier, more practical view of challenges that traffic engineers encounter. To this end, we present the I-24 MOTION Scenario Dataset (I24-MSD)-a standardized, curated dataset designed to preserve a realistic level of sensor imperfection, embracing these errors as part of the learning problem rather than an obstacle to overcome purely from preprocessing. Drawing from noise-aware learning strategies in computer vision, we further adapt existing generative models in the autonomous driving community for I24-MSD with noise-aware loss functions. Our results show that such models not only outperform traditional baselines in realism but also benefit from explicitly engaging with, rather than suppressing, data imperfection. We view I24-MSD as a stepping stone toward a new generation of microscopic traffic simulation that embraces the real-world challenges and is better aligned with practical needs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mitigating Traffic Oscillations in Mixed Traffic Flow with Scalable Deep Koopman Predictive Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00043v3)** | 2025-08-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mitigating traffic oscillations in mixed flows of connected automated vehicles (CAVs) and human-driven vehicles (HDVs) is critical for enhancing traffic stability. A key challenge lies in modeling the nonlinear, heterogeneous behaviors of HDVs within computationally tractable predictive control frameworks. This study proposes an adaptive deep Koopman predictive control framework (AdapKoopPC) to address this issue. The framework features a novel deep Koopman network, AdapKoopnet, which represents complex HDV car-following dynamics as a linear system in a high-dimensional space by adaptively learning from naturalistic data. This learned linear representation is then embedded into a Model Predictive Control (MPC) scheme, enabling real-time, scalable, and optimal control of CAVs. We validate our framework using the HighD dataset and extensive numerical simulations. Results demonstrate that AdapKoopnet achieves superior trajectory prediction accuracy over baseline models. Furthermore, the complete AdapKoopPC controller significantly dampens traffic oscillations with lower computational cost, exhibiting strong performance even at low CAV penetration rates. The proposed framework offers a scalable and data-driven solution for enhancing stability in realistic mixed traffic environments. The code is made publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[When Competition Helps: Achieving Optimal Traffic Flow with Multiple Autonomous Planners](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07145v1)** | 2025-08-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The inefficiency of selfish routing in congested networks is a classical problem in algorithmic game theory, often captured by the Price of Anarchy (i.e., the ratio between the social cost of decentralized decisions and that of a centrally optimized solution.) With the advent of autonomous vehicles, capable of receiving and executing centrally assigned routes, it is natural to ask whether their deployment can eliminate this inefficiency. At first glance, a central authority could simply compute an optimal traffic assignment and instruct each vehicle to follow its assigned path. However, this vision overlooks critical challenges: routes must be individually rational (no vehicle has an incentive to deviate), and in practice, multiple planning agents (e.g., different companies) may coexist and compete. Surprisingly, we show that such competition is not merely an obstacle but a necessary ingredient for achieving optimal outcomes. In this work, we design a routing mechanism that embraces competition and converges to an optimal assignment, starting from the classical Pigou network as a foundational case.</p></details> |  |

However, existing models are often task-oriented and are trained with tailored data, which limits their effectiveness in diverse mobile network tasks of Base Station (BS) deployment, resource allocation, energy optimization, etc. and hinders generalization across different urban environments. Foundation models have made remarkable strides across various domains of NLP and CV due to their multi-tasking adaption and zero/few-shot learning capabilities. In this paper, we propose an innovative Foundation model for Mo}bile traffic forecasting (FoMo), aiming to handle diverse forecasting tasks of short/long-term predictions and distribution generation across multiple cities to support network planning and optimization. FoMo combines diffusion models and transformers, where various spatio-temporal masks are proposed to enable FoMo to learn intrinsic features of different tasks, and a contrastive learning strategy is developed to capture the correlations between mobile traffic and urban contexts, thereby improving its transfer learning capability. Extensive experiments on 9 real-world datasets demonstrate that FoMo outperforms current models concerning diverse forecasting tasks and zero/few-shot learning, showcasing a strong universality.</p></details> | <details><summary>2025 ...</summary><p>2025 ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, KDD 2025</p></details> |

While Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have shown benefits in modeling complex traffic dependencies, the existing GCN-based approaches cannot fully extract and fuse multi-granular spatiotemporal features across various spatial and temporal scales sufficiently in a complete manner, proven to yield less accurate results. Besides, as extracting multi-granular features across scales has been a promising strategy across domains such as computer vision, natural language processing, and time-series forecasting, pioneering studies have attempted to leverage a similar mechanism for spatiotemporal traffic data mining. However, additional feature extraction branches introduced in prior studies critically increased model complexity and extended inference time, making it challenging to provide fast forecasts. In this paper, we propose MultiGran-STGCNFog, an efficient fog distributed inference system with a novel traffic forecasting model that employs multi-granular spatiotemporal feature fusion on generated dynamic traffic graphs to fully capture interdependent traffic dynamics.

| **[Lightweight Auto-bidding based on Traffic Prediction in Live Advertising](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06069v1)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Internet live streaming is widely used in online entertainment and e-commerce, where live advertising is an important marketing tool for anchors. An advertising campaign hopes to maximize the effect (such as conversions) under constraints (such as budget and cost-per-click). The mainstream control of campaigns is auto-bidding, where the performance depends on the decision of the bidding algorithm in each request. The most widely used auto-bidding algorithms include Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) control, linear programming (LP), reinforcement learning (RL), etc. Existing methods either do not consider the entire time traffic, or have too high computational complexity. In this paper, the live advertising has high requirements for real-time bidding (second-level control) and faces the difficulty of unknown future traffic. Therefore, we propose a lightweight bidding algorithm Binary Constrained Bidding (BiCB), which neatly combines the optimal bidding formula given by mathematical analysis and the statistical method of future traffic estimation, and obtains good approximation to the optimal result through a low complexity solution. In addition, we complement the form of upper and lower bound constraints for traditional auto-bidding modeling and give theoretical analysis of BiCB. Sufficient offline and online experiments prove BiCB's good performance and low engineering cost.</p></details> |  |

Deep learning has advanced video-based traffic monitoring through video question answering (VideoQA) models, enabling structured insight extraction from traffic videos. However, existing VideoQA models struggle with the complexity of real-world traffic scenes, where multiple concurrent events unfold across spatiotemporal dimensions. To address these challenges, this paper introduces \textbf{InterAct VideoQA}, a curated dataset designed to benchmark and enhance VideoQA models for traffic monitoring tasks. The InterAct VideoQA dataset comprises 8 hours of real-world traffic footage collected from diverse intersections, segmented into 10-second video clips, with over 25,000 question-answer (QA) pairs covering spatiotemporal dynamics, vehicle interactions, incident detection, and other critical traffic attributes. State-of-the-art VideoQA models are evaluated on InterAct VideoQA, exposing challenges in reasoning over fine-grained spatiotemporal dependencies within complex traffic scenarios. Additionally, fine-tuning these models on InterAct VideoQA yields notable performance improvements, demonstrating the necessity of domain-specific datasets for VideoQA. InterAct VideoQA is publicly available as a benchmark dataset to facilitate future research in real-world deployable VideoQA models for intelligent transportation systems.

| **[Spatio-Temporal Partial Sensing Forecast for Long-term Traffic](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02689v2)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic forecasting uses recent measurements by sensors installed at chosen locations to forecast the future road traffic. Existing work either assumes all locations are equipped with sensors or focuses on short-term forecast. This paper studies partial sensing forecast of long-term traffic, assuming sensors are available only at some locations. The problem is challenging due to the unknown data distribution at unsensed locations, the intricate spatio-temporal correlation in long-term forecasting, as well as noise to traffic patterns. We propose a Spatio-temporal Long-term Partial sensing Forecast model (SLPF) for traffic prediction, with several novel contributions, including a rank-based embedding technique to reduce the impact of noise in data, a spatial transfer matrix to overcome the spatial distribution shift from sensed locations to unsensed locations, and a multi-step training process that utilizes all available data to successively refine the model parameters for better accuracy. Extensive experiments on several real-world traffic datasets demonstrate its superior performance.

However, accurate forecasting is difficult due to intricate spatial and temporal patterns that exist due to the mobility of users. Existing AI-based traffic forecasting models often trade-off accuracy and computational efficiency. We present Hierarchical SpatioTemporal Mamba (HiSTM), which combines a dual spatial encoder with a Mamba-based temporal module and attention mechanism. HiSTM employs selective state space methods to capture spatial and temporal patterns in network traffic. In our evaluation, we use a real-world dataset to compare HiSTM against several baselines, showing a 29.4% MAE improvement over the STN baseline while using 94% fewer parameters. We show that the HiSTM generalizes well across different datasets and improves in accuracy over longer time-horizons.</p></details> |  |
| **[Channel-Independent Federated Traffic Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04517v1)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, traffic prediction has achieved remarkable success and has become an integral component of intelligent transportation systems. However, traffic data is typically distributed among multiple data owners, and privacy constraints prevent the direct utilization of these isolated datasets for traffic prediction. Most existing federated traffic prediction methods focus on designing communication mechanisms that allow models to leverage information from other clients in order to improve prediction accuracy. Unfortunately, such approaches often incur substantial communication overhead, and the resulting transmission delays significantly slow down the training process. As the volume of traffic data continues to grow, this issue becomes increasingly critical, making the resource consumption of current methods unsustainable. To address this challenge, we propose a novel variable relationship modeling paradigm for federated traffic prediction, termed the Channel-Independent Paradigm(CIP). Unlike traditional approaches, CIP eliminates the need for inter-client communication by enabling each node to perform efficient and accurate predictions using only local information. Based on the CIP, we further develop Fed-CI, an efficient federated learning framework, allowing each client to process its own data independently while effectively mitigating the information loss caused by the lack of direct data sharing among clients. Fed-CI significantly reduces communication overhead, accelerates the training process, and achieves state-of-the-art performance while complying with privacy regulations. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that Fed-CI consistently outperforms existing methods across all datasets and federated settings. It achieves improvements of 8%, 14%, and 16% in RMSE, MAE, and MAPE, respectively, while also substantially reducing communication costs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reconstructing Physics-Informed Machine Learning for Traffic Flow Modeling: a Multi-Gradient Descent and Pareto Learning Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13241v2)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Physics-informed machine learning (PIML) is crucial in modern traffic flow modeling because it combines the benefits of both physics-based and data-driven approaches. In conventional PIML, physical information is typically incorporated by constructing a hybrid loss function that combines data-driven loss and physics loss through linear scalarization. The goal is to find a trade-off between these two objectives to improve the accuracy of model predictions. However, from a mathematical perspective, linear scalarization is limited to identifying only the convex region of the Pareto front, as it treats data-driven and physics losses as separate objectives. Given that most PIML loss functions are non-convex, linear scalarization restricts the achievable trade-off solutions. Moreover, tuning the weighting coefficients for the two loss components can be both time-consuming and computationally challenging. To address these limitations, this paper introduces a paradigm shift in PIML by reformulating the training process as a multi-objective optimization problem, treating data-driven loss and physics loss independently. We apply several multi-gradient descent algorithms (MGDAs), including traditional multi-gradient descent (TMGD) and dual cone gradient descent (DCGD), to explore the Pareto front in this multi-objective setting. These methods are evaluated on both macroscopic and microscopic traffic flow models. In the macroscopic case, MGDAs achieved comparable performance to traditional linear scalarization methods. Notably, in the microscopic case, MGDAs significantly outperformed their scalarization-based counterparts, demonstrating the advantages of a multi-objective optimization approach in complex PIML scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Given the prohibitive computational cost of learning individual policies for each intersection, some researchers explore learning a universal policy to control each intersection in a decentralized manner, where the key challenge is to construct a universal representation method for heterogeneous intersections. However, existing methods are limited to universally representing information of heterogeneous ego intersections, neglecting the essential representation of influence from their heterogeneous neighbors. Universally incorporating neighborhood information is nontrivial due to the intrinsic complexity of traffic flow interactions, as well as the challenge of modeling collective influences from neighbor intersections. To address these challenges, we propose CityLight, which learns a universal policy based on representations obtained with two major modules: a Neighbor Influence Encoder to explicitly model neighbor's influence with specified traffic flow relation and connectivity to the ego intersection; a Neighbor Influence Aggregator to attentively aggregate the influence of neighbors based on their mutual competitive relations. Extensive experiments on five city-scale datasets, ranging from 97 to 13,952 intersections, confirm the efficacy of CityLight, with an average throughput improvement of 11.68% and a lift of 22.59% for generalization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CIKM 2025</p></details> |

We propose InfGen, a unified next-token prediction model that performs interleaved closed-loop motion simulation and scene generation. InfGen automatically switches between closed-loop motion simulation and scene generation mode. It enables stable long-term rollout simulation. InfGen performs at the state-of-the-art in short-term (9s) traffic simulation, and significantly outperforms all other methods in long-term (30s) simulation.

While most existing attacks exploit ML techniques for discovering such traffic patterns, they underperform on wireless traffic, especially Wi-Fi, due to its heavy noise and packet losses of wireless sniffing. In addition, these approaches commonly target at distinguishing chunked IoT event traffic samples, and they failed at effectively tracking multiple events simultaneously. In this work, we propose WiFinger, a fine-grained multi-IoT event fingerprinting approach against noisy traffic. WiFinger turns the traffic pattern classification task into a subsequence matching problem and introduces novel techniques to account for the high time complexity while maintaining high accuracy. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches on Wi-Fi traffic, achieving an average recall of 85% (vs. 0.49% and 0.46%) for various IoT events while maintaining almost zero false positives for most of them.</p></details> |  |
| **[MIDAR: Mimicking LiDAR Detection for Traffic Applications with a Lightweight Plug-and-Play Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02858v1)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As autonomous driving (AD) technology advances, increasing research has focused on leveraging cooperative perception (CP) data collected from multiple AVs to enhance traffic applications. Due to the impracticality of large-scale real-world AV deployments, simulation has become the primary approach in most studies. While game-engine-based simulators like CARLA generate high-fidelity raw sensor data (e.g., LiDAR point clouds) which can be used to produce realistic detection outputs, they face scalability challenges in multi-AV scenarios. In contrast, microscopic traffic simulators such as SUMO scale efficiently but lack perception modeling capabilities. To bridge this gap, we propose MIDAR, a LiDAR detection mimicking model that approximates realistic LiDAR detections using vehicle-level features readily available from microscopic traffic simulators. Specifically, MIDAR predicts true positives (TPs) and false negatives (FNs) from ideal LiDAR detection results based on the spatial layouts and dimensions of surrounding vehicles. A Refined Multi-hop Line-of-Sight (RM-LoS) graph is constructed to encode the occlusion relationships among vehicles, upon which MIDAR employs a GRU-enhanced APPNP architecture to propagate features from the ego AV and occluding vehicles to the prediction target. MIDAR achieves an AUC of 0.909 in approximating the detection results generated by CenterPoint, a mainstream 3D LiDAR detection model, on the nuScenes AD dataset. Two CP-based traffic applications further validate the necessity of such realistic detection modeling, particularly for tasks requiring accurate individual vehicle observations (e.g., position, speed, lane index). As demonstrated in the applications, MIDAR can be seamlessly integrated into traffic simulators and trajectory datasets and will be open-sourced upon publication.</p></details> | 18 pages, 9 figures |

In this paper, we introduce Traffic-R1, a foundation model with human-like reasoning for TSC systems. Our model is developed through self-exploration and iteration of reinforced large language models (LLMs) with expert guidance in a simulated traffic environment. Compared to traditional reinforcement learning (RL) and recent LLM-based methods, Traffic-R1 offers three significant advantages. First, Traffic-R1 delivers zero-shot generalisation, transferring unchanged to new road networks and out-of-distribution incidents by utilizing its internal traffic control policies and human-like reasoning. Second, its 3B-parameter architecture is lightweight enough for real-time inference on mobile-class chips, enabling large-scale edge deployment. Third, Traffic-R1 provides an explainable TSC process and facilitates multi-intersection communication through its self-iteration and a new synchronous communication network. Extensive benchmarks demonstrate that Traffic-R1 sets a new state of the art, outperforming strong baselines and training-intensive RL controllers. In practice, the model now manages signals for more than 55,000 drivers daily, shortening average queues by over 5% and halving operator workload.

| **[Distillation-Enhanced Clustering Acceleration for Encrypted Traffic Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02282v1)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic classification plays a significant role in network service management. The advancement of deep learning has established pretrained models as a robust approach for this task. However, contemporary encrypted traffic classification systems face dual limitations. Firstly, pretrained models typically exhibit large-scale architectures, where their extensive parameterization results in slow inference speeds and high computational latency. Secondly, reliance on labeled data for fine-tuning restricts these models to predefined supervised classes, creating a bottleneck when novel traffic types emerge in the evolving Internet landscape. To address these challenges, we propose NetClus, a novel framework integrating pretrained models with distillation-enhanced clustering acceleration. During fine-tuning, NetClus first introduces a cluster-friendly loss to jointly reshape the latent space for both classification and clustering. With the fine-tuned model, it distills the model into a lightweight Feed-Forward Neural Network model to retain semantics. During inference, NetClus performs heuristic merge with near-linear runtime, and valid the cluster purity with newly proposed metrics ASI to identify emergent traffic types while expediting classification. Benchmarked against existing pretrained methods, NetClus achieves up to 6.2x acceleration while maintaining classification degradation below 1%.</p></details> | Under review |
| **[Real-Time Conflict Prediction for Large Truck Merging in Mixed Traffic at Work Zone Lane Closures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02109v1)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large trucks substantially contribute to work zone-related crashes, primarily due to their large size and blind spots. When approaching a work zone, large trucks often need to merge into an adjacent lane because of lane closures caused by construction activities. This study aims to enhance the safety of large truck merging maneuvers in work zones by evaluating the risk associated with merging conflicts and establishing a decision-making strategy for merging based on this risk assessment. To predict the risk of large trucks merging into a mixed traffic stream within a work zone, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network is employed. For a large truck intending to merge, it is critical that the immediate downstream vehicle in the target lane maintains a minimum safe gap to facilitate a safe merging process. Once a conflict-free merging opportunity is predicted, large trucks are instructed to merge in response to the lane closure. Our LSTM-based conflict prediction method is compared against baseline approaches, which include probabilistic risk-based merging, 50th percentile gap-based merging, and 85th percentile gap-based merging strategies. The results demonstrate that our method yields a lower conflict risk, as indicated by reduced Time Exposed Time-to-Collision (TET) and Time Integrated Time-to-Collision (TIT) values relative to the baseline models. Furthermore, the findings indicate that large trucks that use our method can perform early merging while still in motion, as opposed to coming to a complete stop at the end of the current lane prior to closure, which is commonly observed with the baseline approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the Transportation Research Record: Journal of the Transportation Research Board for possible publication</p></details> |
| **[Traffic Scene Generation from Natural Language Description for Autonomous Vehicles with Large Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09575v3)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating realistic and controllable traffic scenes from natural language can greatly enhance the development and evaluation of autonomous driving systems. However, this task poses unique challenges: (1) grounding free-form text into spatially valid and semantically coherent layouts, (2) composing scenarios without predefined locations, and (3) planning multi-agent behaviors and selecting roads that respect agents' configurations. To address these, we propose a modular framework, TTSG, comprising prompt analysis, road retrieval, agent planning, and a novel plan-aware road ranking algorithm to solve these challenges. While large language models (LLMs) are used as general planners, our design integrates them into a tightly controlled pipeline that enforces structure, feasibility, and scene diversity. Notably, our ranking strategy ensures consistency between agent actions and road geometry, enabling scene generation without predefined routes or spawn points. The framework supports both routine and safety-critical scenarios, as well as multi-stage event composition. Experiments on SafeBench demonstrate that our method achieves the lowest average collision rate (3.5\%) across three critical scenarios. Moreover, driving captioning models trained on our generated scenes improve action reasoning by over 30 CIDEr points. These results underscore our proposed framework for flexible, interpretable, and safety-oriented simulation.</p></details> |  |

Widely used datasets, such as Mapillary, often provide only coarse-grained labels - without distinguishing semantically important types such as stop signs or speed limit signs. To this end, we present a new validation set for traffic signs derived from the Mapillary dataset called Mapillary Vistas Validation for Traffic Signs (MVV), where we decompose composite traffic signs into granular, semantically meaningful categories. The dataset includes pixel-level instance masks and has been manually annotated by expert annotators to ensure label fidelity. Further, we benchmark several state-of-the-art VLMs against the self-supervised DINOv2 model on this dataset and show that DINOv2 consistently outperforms all VLM baselines-not only on traffic sign recognition, but also on heavily represented categories like vehicles and humans. Our analysis reveals significant limitations in current vision-language models for fine-grained visual understanding and establishes DINOv2 as a strong baseline for dense semantic matching in autonomous driving scenarios.

Network traffic classification(ETC) can analyzes attributes such as application categories and malicious intent, supporting network management services like QoS optimization, intrusion detection, and targeted billing. As the prevalence of traffic encryption increases, deep learning models are relied upon for content-agnostic analysis of packet sequences. However, the emergence of new services and attack variants often leads to incremental tasks for ETC models. To ensure model effectiveness, incremental learning techniques are essential; however, recent studies indicate that neural networks experience declining plasticity as tasks increase. We identified plasticity issues in existing incremental learning methods across diverse traffic samples and proposed the PRIME framework. By observing the effective rank of model parameters and the proportion of inactive neurons, the PRIME architecture can appropriately increase the parameter scale when the model's plasticity deteriorates. Experiments show that in multiple encrypted traffic datasets and different category increment scenarios, the PRIME architecture performs significantly better than other incremental learning algorithms with minimal increase in parameter scale.</p></details> |  |

To reduce reliance on handcrafted features and labeled data, recent methods focus on learning generic representations through pre-training on large-scale unlabeled data. However, current pre-trained models face two limitations originating from the adopted Transformer architecture: (1) Limited model efficiency due to the self-attention mechanism with quadratic complexity; (2) Unstable traffic scalability to longer byte sequences, as the explicit positional encodings fail to generalize to input lengths not seen during pre-training. In this paper, we investigate whether convolutions, with linear complexity and implicit positional encoding, are competitive with Transformers in encrypted traffic classification with pre-training. We first conduct a systematic comparison, and observe that convolutions achieve higher efficiency and scalability, with lower classification performance. To address this trade-off, we propose NetConv, a novel pre-trained convolution model for encrypted traffic classification. NetConv employs stacked traffic convolution layers, which enhance the ability to capture localized byte-sequence patterns through window-wise byte scoring and sequence-wise byte gating. We design a continuous byte masking pre-training task to help NetConv learn protocol-specific patterns. Experimental results on four tasks demonstrate that NetConv improves average classification performance by 6.88% and model throughput by 7.41X over existing pre-trained models.</p></details> | Under review |

Many existing approaches adopt an SQL-based paradigm for querying such large-scale video databases; however, this constrains queries to rigid patterns with predefined semantic categories, significantly limiting analytical flexibility. In this work, we explore a language-driven video analytics paradigm aimed at enabling flexible and efficient querying of high-volume video data driven by natural language. Particularly, we build \textsc{Lava}, a system that accepts natural language queries and retrieves traffic targets across multiple levels of granularity and arbitrary categories. \textsc{Lava} comprises three main components: 1) a multi-armed bandit-based efficient sampling method for video segment-level localization; 2) a video-specific open-world detection module for object-level retrieval; and 3) a long-term object trajectory extraction scheme for temporal object association, yielding complete trajectories for object-of-interests. To support comprehensive evaluation, we further develop a novel benchmark by providing diverse, semantically rich natural language predicates and fine-grained annotations for multiple videos. Experiments on this benchmark demonstrate that \textsc{Lava} improves $F_1$-scores for selection queries by $\mathbf{14\%}$, reduces MPAE for aggregation queries by $\mathbf{0.39}$, and achieves top-$k$ precision of $\mathbf{86\%}$, while processing videos $ \mathbf{9.6\times} $ faster than the most accurate baseline.

It is an important problem in intelligent transportation systems, with a plethora of methods been proposed. Existing efforts mainly focus on capturing and utilizing spatio-temporal dependencies to predict future traffic flows. Though promising, they fall short in adapting to test-time environmental changes of traffic conditions. To tackle this challenge, we propose to introduce large language models (LLMs) to help traffic flow forecasting and design a novel method named Large Language Model Enhanced Traffic Flow Predictor (LEAF). LEAF adopts two branches, capturing different spatio-temporal relations using graph and hypergraph structures respectively. The two branches are first pre-trained individually, and during test-time, they yield different predictions. Based on these predictions, a large language model is used to select the most likely result. Then, a ranking loss is applied as the learning objective to enhance the prediction ability of the two branches. Extensive experiments on several datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed LEAF.</p></details> | Accepted by ACL 2025 |

Nevertheless, the telecom industry still heavily relies on manual expert intervention. Existing studies have been focused on exhaustively explore the spatial-temporal correlations. However, they often overlook the underlying characteristics of cellular traffic, which are shaped by the sporadic and bursty nature of telecom services. Additionally, concept drift creates substantial obstacles to maintaining satisfactory accuracy in continuous cellular forecasting tasks. To resolve these problems, we put forward an online cellular traffic prediction method grounded in Multi-Grained Spatial-Temporal feature Complementarity (MGSTC). The proposed method is devised to achieve high-precision predictions in practical continuous forecasting scenarios. Concretely, MGSTC segments historical data into chunks and employs the coarse-grained temporal attention to offer a trend reference for the prediction horizon. Subsequently, fine-grained spatial attention is utilized to capture detailed correlations among network elements, which enables localized refinement of the established trend. The complementarity of these multi-grained spatial-temporal features facilitates the efficient transmission of valuable information. To accommodate continuous forecasting needs, we implement an online learning strategy that can detect concept drift in real-time and promptly switch to the appropriate parameter update stage.

In reality, internet traffic is non-Markovian, and past states do influence routing performance. Moreover, common deep RL approaches use function approximators, such as neural networks, that do not model the spatial structure in network topologies. To address these shortcomings, we design a network environment with non-Markovian traffic and introduce a spatial-temporal RL (STRL) framework for packet routing. Our approach outperforms traditional baselines by more than 19% during training and 7% for inference despite a change in network topology.</p></details> |  |

Most state-of-the-art (SotA) prediction models primarily focus on forecasting the most likely future. However, for the safe operation of autonomous vehicles, it is equally important to cover the distribution for plausible motion alternatives. To address this, we introduce EP-Diffuser, a novel parameter-efficient diffusion-based generative model designed to capture the distribution of possible traffic scene evolutions. Conditioned on road layout and agent history, our model acts as a predictor and generates diverse, plausible scene continuations. We benchmark EP-Diffuser against two SotA models in terms of accuracy and plausibility of predictions on the Argoverse 2 dataset. Despite its significantly smaller model size, our approach achieves both highly accurate and plausible traffic scene predictions. We further evaluate model generalization ability in an out-of-distribution (OoD) test setting using Waymo Open dataset and show superior robustness of our approach.

| **[Contrastive Learning-Driven Traffic Sign Perception: Multi-Modal Fusion of Text and Vision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23331v1)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic sign recognition, as a core component of autonomous driving perception systems, directly influences vehicle environmental awareness and driving safety. Current technologies face two significant challenges: first, the traffic sign dataset exhibits a pronounced long-tail distribution, resulting in a substantial decline in recognition performance of traditional convolutional networks when processing low-frequency and out-of-distribution classes; second, traffic signs in real-world scenarios are predominantly small targets with significant scale variations, making it difficult to extract multi-scale features.To overcome these issues, we propose a novel two-stage framework combining open-vocabulary detection and cross-modal learning. For traffic sign detection, our NanoVerse YOLO model integrates a reparameterizable vision-language path aggregation network (RepVL-PAN) and an SPD-Conv module to specifically enhance feature extraction for small, multi-scale targets. For traffic sign classification, we designed a Traffic Sign Recognition Multimodal Contrastive Learning model (TSR-MCL). By contrasting visual features from a Vision Transformer with semantic features from a rule-based BERT, TSR-MCL learns robust, frequency-independent representations, effectively mitigating class confusion caused by data imbalance. On the TT100K dataset, our method achieves a state-of-the-art 78.4% mAP in the long-tail detection task for all-class recognition. The model also obtains 91.8% accuracy and 88.9% recall, significantly outperforming mainstream algorithms and demonstrating superior accuracy and generalization in complex, open-world scenarios.</p></details> | 11pages, 5 figures |

However, existing traffic simulation methods face challenges in their controllability. To address this, we propose a novel diffusion-based and LLM-enhanced traffic simulation framework. Our approach incorporates a high-level understanding module and a low-level refinement module, which systematically examines the hierarchical structure of traffic elements, guides LLMs to thoroughly analyze traffic scenario descriptions step by step, and refines the generation by self-reflection, enhancing their understanding of complex situations. Furthermore, we propose a Frenet-frame-based cost function framework that provides LLMs with geometrically meaningful quantities, improving their grasp of spatial relationships in a scenario and enabling more accurate cost function generation. Experiments on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD) demonstrate that our method can handle more intricate descriptions and generate a broader range of scenarios in a controllable manner.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IROS 2025</p></details> |

Nevertheless, the complete potential of Green Wave systems has yet to be explored. Utilizing emerging technologies and advanced algorithms, such as AI or V2X, would aid in achieving more robust traffic management strategies, especially when integrated with Green Wave. This work comprehensively surveys existing traffic control strategies that enable Green Waves and analyzes their impact on future traffic management systems and urban infrastructure. Understanding previous research on traffic management and its effect on traffic efficiency and safety helps explore the integration of Green Wave solutions with smart city initiatives for effective traffic signal coordination. This paper also discusses the advantages of using Green Wave strategies for emission reduction and considers road safety issues for vulnerable road users, such as pedestrians and cyclists. Finally, the existing challenges and research gaps in building robust and successful Green Wave systems are discussed to articulate explicitly the future requirement of sustainable urban transport.</p></details> |  |

Autonomous driving technologies have emerged as a potential solution. Among traffic control methods, reinforcement learning has shown superior performance over traffic signals in various scenarios. However, prior research has largely focused on small-scale networks or isolated intersections, leaving large-scale mixed traffic control largely unexplored. This study presents the first attempt to use decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning for large-scale mixed traffic control in which some intersections are managed by traffic signals and others by robot vehicles. Evaluating a real-world network in Colorado Springs, CO, USA with 14 intersections, we measure traffic efficiency via average waiting time of vehicles at intersections and the number of vehicles reaching their destinations within a time window (i.e., throughput). At 80% RV penetration rate, our method reduces waiting time from 6.17s to 5.09s and increases throughput from 454 vehicles per 500 seconds to 493 vehicles per 500 seconds, outperforming the baseline of fully signalized intersections. These findings suggest that integrating reinforcement learning-based control large-scale traffic can improve overall efficiency and may inform future urban planning strategies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS), 2025</p></details> |

However, as System Optimum makes some drivers better off than others, voluntary acceptance seems dubious. To overcome this issue, we propose a new concept of Wardropian cycles, which, in contrast to previous utopian visions, makes the assignment fair on top of being optimal, which amounts to satisfaction of both Wardrop's principles. Such cycles, represented as sequences of permutations to the daily assignment matrices, always exist and equalise, after a limited number of days, average travel times among travellers (like in User Equilibrium) while preserving everyday optimality of path flows (like in System Optimum). We propose exact methods to compute such cycles and reduce their length and within-cycle inconvenience to the users. As identification of optimal cycles turns out to be NP-hard in many aspects, we introduce a greedy heuristic efficiently approximating the optimal solution. Finally, we introduce and discuss a new paradigm of Cyclical User Equilibrium, which ensures stability of optimal Wardropian Cycles under unilateral deviations. We complement our theoretical study with large-scale simulations. In Barcelona, 670 vehicle-hours of Price-of-Anarchy are eliminated using cycles with a median length of 11 days-though 5% of cycles exceed 90 days. However, in Berlin, just five days of applying the greedy assignment rule significantly reduces initial inequity. In Barcelona, Anaheim, and Sioux Falls, less than 7% of the initial inequity remains after 10 days, demonstrating the effectiveness of this approach in improving traffic performance with more ubiquitous social acceptability.</p></details> |  |

Recent LiDAR scene flow models utilize the rigid-motion assumption at the instance level, assuming objects are rigid bodies. However, these instance-level methods are not suitable for sparse radar point clouds. In this work, we present a novel Traffic-Aware Radar Scene-Flow (TARS) estimation method, which utilizes motion rigidity at the traffic level. To address the challenges in radar scene flow, we perform object detection and scene flow jointly and boost the latter. We incorporate the feature map from the object detector, trained with detection losses, to make radar scene flow aware of the environment and road users. From this, we construct a Traffic Vector Field (TVF) in the feature space to achieve holistic traffic-level scene understanding in our scene flow branch. When estimating the scene flow, we consider both point-level motion cues from point neighbors and traffic-level consistency of rigid motion within the space. TARS outperforms the state of the art on a proprietary dataset and the View-of-Delft dataset, improving the benchmarks by 23% and 15%, respectively.</p></details> |  |

However, obtaining lane-level traffic data has become a critical bottleneck for data-driven models due to limitations in the types and number of sensors and issues with the accuracy of tracking algorithms. To address this, we propose the Fine-grained Road Traffic Inference (FRTI) task, which aims to generate more detailed lane-level traffic information using limited road data, providing a more energy-efficient and cost-effective solution for precise traffic management. This task is abstracted as the first scene of the spatio-temporal graph node generation problem. We designed a two-stage framework--RoadDiff--to solve the FRTI task. solve the FRTI task. This framework leverages the Road-Lane Correlation Autoencoder-Decoder and the Lane Diffusion Module to fully utilize the limited spatio-temporal dependencies and distribution relationships of road data to accurately infer fine-grained lane traffic states. Based on existing research, we designed several baseline models with the potential to solve the FRTI task and conducted extensive experiments on six datasets representing different road conditions to validate the effectiveness of the RoadDiff model in addressing the FRTI task. The relevant datasets and code are available at https://github.com/ShuhaoLii/RoadDiff.</p></details> |  |

However, the dynamic traffic flow forecasting is a highly nonlinear problem with complex temporal-spatial dependencies. Although the existing methods has provided great contributions to mine the temporal-spatial patterns in the complex traffic networks, they fail to encode the globally temporal-spatial patterns and are prone to overfit on the pre-defined geographical correlations, and thus hinder the model's robustness on the complex traffic environment. To tackle this issue, in this work, we proposed a multi-grained temporal-spatial graph learning framework to adaptively augment the globally temporal-spatial patterns obtained from a crafted graph transformer encoder with the local patterns from the graph convolution by a crafted gated fusion unit with residual connection techniques. Under these circumstances, our proposed model can mine the hidden global temporal-spatial relations between each monitor stations and balance the relative importance of local and global temporal-spatial patterns. Experiment results demonstrate the strong representation capability of our proposed method and our model consistently outperforms other strong baselines on various real-world traffic networks.</p></details> |  |

Current approaches often hinge on predefined driver models, objective optimization, or reliance on pre-recorded driving datasets, imposing limitations on their scalability, versatility, and adaptability. In this paper, we introduce TrafficMCTS, an innovative framework that harnesses the synergy of group-based Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) and Social Value Orientation (SVO) to engender a multifaceted traffic flow with varying driving styles and cooperative tendencies. Anchored by a closed-loop architecture, our framework enables vehicles to dynamically adapt to their environment in real time, and ensure feasible collision-free trajectories. Through comprehensive comparisons with state-of-the-art methods, we illuminate the advantages of our approach in terms of computational efficiency, planning success rate, intention completion time, and diversity metrics. Besides, we simulate multiple scenarios to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework and highlight its ability to induce diverse social behaviors within the traffic flow. Finally, we validate the scalability of TrafficMCTS by demonstrating its capability to efficiently simulate diverse traffic scenarios involving numerous interacting vehicles within a complex road network, capturing the intricate dynamics of human-like driving behaviors.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems</p></details> |

We focus on value conflicts-situations in which agents face competing goals rooted in value-laden situations and show how conflict analysis can inform key phases of the design process. This includes value elicitation, capability specification, explanation, and adaptive system refinement. We elaborate and apply the concept of Value-Aligned Operational Design Domains (VODDs) to structure autonomy in accordance with contextual value priorities.

| **[Machine Unlearning of Traffic State Estimation and Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17984v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data-driven traffic state estimation and prediction (TSEP) relies heavily on data sources that contain sensitive information. While the abundance of data has fueled significant breakthroughs, particularly in machine learning-based methods, it also raises concerns regarding privacy, cybersecurity, and data freshness. These issues can erode public trust in intelligent transportation systems. Recently, regulations have introduced the "right to be forgotten", allowing users to request the removal of their private data from models. As machine learning models can remember old data, simply removing it from back-end databases is insufficient in such systems. To address these challenges, this study introduces a novel learning paradigm for TSEP-Machine Unlearning TSEP-which enables a trained TSEP model to selectively forget privacy-sensitive, poisoned, or outdated data. By empowering models to "unlearn," we aim to enhance the trustworthiness and reliability of data-driven traffic TSEP.</p></details> |  |
| **[LSDM: LLM-Enhanced Spatio-temporal Diffusion Model for Service-Level Mobile Traffic Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17795v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Service-level mobile traffic prediction for individual users is essential for network efficiency and quality of service enhancement. However, current prediction methods are limited in their adaptability across different urban environments and produce inaccurate results due to the high uncertainty in personal traffic patterns, the lack of detailed environmental context, and the complex dependencies among different network services. These challenges demand advanced modeling techniques that can capture dynamic traffic distributions and rich environmental features. Inspired by the recent success of diffusion models in distribution modeling and Large Language Models (LLMs) in contextual understanding, we propose an LLM-Enhanced Spatio-temporal Diffusion Model (LSDM). LSDM integrates the generative power of diffusion models with the adaptive learning capabilities of transformers, augmented by the ability to capture multimodal environmental information for modeling service-level patterns and dynamics. Extensive evaluations on real-world service-level datasets demonstrate that the model excels in traffic usage predictions, showing outstanding generalization and adaptability. After incorporating contextual information via LLM, the performance improves by at least 2.83% in terms of the coefficient of determination. Compared to models of a similar type, such as CSDI, the root mean squared error can be reduced by at least 8.29%. The code and dataset will be available at: https://github.com/SoftYuaneR/LSDM.</p></details> | 14 pages, 9 figures |

This work introduces a novel context-aware zero-shot anomaly detection framework that identifies abnormal events without exposure to anomaly examples during training. The proposed hybrid architecture combines TimeSformer, DPC, and CLIP to model spatiotemporal dynamics and semantic context. TimeSformer serves as the vision backbone to extract rich spatial-temporal features, while DPC forecasts future representations to identify temporal deviations. Furthermore, a CLIP-based semantic stream enables concept-level anomaly detection through context-specific text prompts. These components are jointly trained using InfoNCE and CPC losses, aligning visual inputs with their temporal and semantic representations. A context-gating mechanism further enhances decision-making by modulating predictions with scene-aware cues or global video features. By integrating predictive modeling with vision-language understanding, the system can generalize to previously unseen behaviors in complex environments. This framework bridges the gap between temporal reasoning and semantic context in zero-shot anomaly detection for surveillance. The code for this research has been made available at https://github.com/NK-II/Context-Aware-Zero-Shot-Anomaly-Detection-in-Surveillance.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 7 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

Accurate and early diagnosis of MTS using computed tomography (CT) remains a clinical challenge due to the subtle anatomical compression and variability across patients. In this paper, we propose MTS-Net, an end-to-end 3D deep learning framework designed to capture spatial-temporal patterns from CT volumes for reliable MTS diagnosis. MTS-Net builds upon 3D ResNet-18 by embedding a novel dual-enhanced positional multi-head self-attention (DEP-MHSA) module into the Transformer encoder of the network's final stages. The proposed DEP-MHSA employs multi-scale convolution and integrates positional embeddings into both attention weights and residual paths, enhancing spatial context preservation, which is crucial for identifying venous compression. To validate our approach, we curate the first publicly available dataset for MTS, MTS-CT, containing over 747 gender-balanced subjects with standard and enhanced CT scans. Experimental results demonstrate that MTS-Net achieves average 0.79 accuracy, 0.84 AUC, and 0.78 F1-score, outperforming baseline models including 3D ResNet, DenseNet-BC, and BabyNet. Our work not only introduces a new diagnostic architecture for MTS but also provides a high-quality benchmark dataset to facilitate future research in automated vascular syndrome detection.

They pose, however, significant computational challenges in high-dimensional settings, which frequently arise in spatial-temporal applications. We present DALIA, a highly scalable framework for performing Bayesian inference tasks on spatio-temporal multivariate GPs, based on the methodology of integrated nested Laplace approximations. Our approach relies on a sparse inverse covariance matrix formulation of the GP, puts forward a GPU-accelerated block-dense approach, and introduces a hierarchical, triple-layer, distributed memory parallel scheme. We showcase weak scaling performance surpassing the state-of-the-art by two orders of magnitude on a model whose parameter space is 8$\times$ larger and measure strong scaling speedups of three orders of magnitude when running on 496 GH200 superchips on the Alps supercomputer. Applying DALIA to air pollution data from northern Italy over 48 days, we showcase refined spatial resolutions over the aggregated pollutant measurements.</p></details> |  |

However, generating high-speed, high-quality holographic video requires both high frame rate display and efficient computation, but is constrained by two key limitations: ($i$) Learning-based models often produce over-smoothed phases with narrow angular spectra, causing severe color crosstalk in high frame rate full-color displays such as depth-division multiplexing and thus resulting in a trade-off between frame rate and color fidelity. ($ii$) Existing frame-by-frame optimization methods typically optimize frames independently, neglecting spatial-temporal correlations between consecutive frames and leading to computationally inefficient solutions. To overcome these challenges, in this paper, we propose a novel high-speed full-color video CGH generation scheme. First, we introduce Spectrum-Guided Depth Division Multiplexing (SGDDM), which optimizes phase distributions via frequency modulation, enabling high-fidelity full-color display at high frame rates. Second, we present HoloMamba, a lightweight asymmetric Mamba-Unet architecture that explicitly models spatial-temporal correlations across video sequences to enhance reconstruction quality and computational efficiency. Extensive simulated and real-world experiments demonstrate that SGDDM achieves high-fidelity full-color display without compromise in frame rate, while HoloMamba generates FHD (1080p) full-color holographic video at over 260 FPS, more than 2.6$\times$ faster than the prior state-of-the-art Divide-Conquer-and-Merge Strategy.</p></details> |  |

We focus on a team of robots with diverse capabilities tasked with executing missions specified using Capability Temporal Logic (CaTL), a formal framework built on Signal Temporal Logic to handle spatial, temporal, capability, and resource constraints. The key challenge arises from the uncertainty in the initial distribution and quantity of resources in the environment. To address this, we introduce an iterative algorithm that dynamically balances exploration and task fulfillment. Robots are guided to explore the environment, identifying resource locations and quantities while progressively refining their understanding of the resource landscape. At the same time, they aim to maximally satisfy the mission objectives based on the current information, adapting their strategies as new data is uncovered. This approach provides a robust solution for planning in dynamic, resource-constrained environments, enabling efficient coordination of heterogeneous teams even under conditions of uncertainty. Our method's effectiveness and performance are demonstrated through simulated case studies.</p></details> |  |

The Micro-gesture Online Recognition task is a highly challenging problem that aims to locate the temporal positions and recognize the categories of multiple micro-gesture instances in untrimmed videos. Compared to traditional temporal action detection, this task places greater emphasis on distinguishing between micro-gesture categories and precisely identifying the start and end times of each instance. Moreover, micro-gestures are typically spontaneous human actions, with greater differences than those found in other human actions. To address these challenges, we propose hand-crafted data augmentation and spatial-temporal attention to enhance the model's ability to classify and localize micro-gestures more accurately. Our solution achieved an F1 score of 38.03, outperforming the previous state-of-the-art by 37.9%. As a result, our method ranked first in the Micro-gesture Online Recognition track.</p></details> | 11 pages, 4 figures |

Specifically, we consider a single UAV with 3 degree-of-freedom dynamics tasked with delivering blood packages to multiple hospitals, each with a predefined time window and priority. Mission objectives are encoded using Signal Temporal Logic (STL), enabling the formal specification of spatial-temporal constraints. To ensure safety, city buildings are modeled as 3D convex obstacles, and obstacle avoidance is handled through a Convex Feasible Set (CFS) method. The entire planning problem-combining UAV dynamics, STL satisfaction, and collision avoidance-is formulated as a convex optimization problem that ensures tractability and can be solved efficiently using standard convex programming techniques. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method generates dynamically feasible, collision-free trajectories that satisfy temporal mission goals, providing a scalable and reliable approach for autonomous UAV-based medical logistics.</p></details> | 11 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Why Relational Graphs Will Save the Next Generation of Vision Foundation Models?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18421v1)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision foundation models (FMs) have become the predominant architecture in computer vision, providing highly transferable representations learned from large-scale, multimodal corpora. Nonetheless, they exhibit persistent limitations on tasks that require explicit reasoning over entities, roles, and spatio-temporal relations. Such relational competence is indispensable for fine-grained human activity recognition, egocentric video understanding, and multimodal medical image analysis, where spatial, temporal, and semantic dependencies are decisive for performance. We advance the position that next-generation FMs should incorporate explicit relational interfaces, instantiated as dynamic relational graphs (graphs whose topology and edge semantics are inferred from the input and task context). We illustrate this position with cross-domain evidence from recent systems in human manipulation action recognition and brain tumor segmentation, showing that augmenting FMs with lightweight, context-adaptive graph-reasoning modules improves fine-grained semantic fidelity, out of distribution robustness, interpretability, and computational efficiency relative to FM only baselines. Importantly, by reasoning sparsely over semantic nodes, such hybrids also achieve favorable memory and hardware efficiency, enabling deployment under practical resource constraints. We conclude with a targeted research agenda for FM graph hybrids, prioritizing learned dynamic graph construction, multi-level relational reasoning (e.g., part object scene in activity understanding, or region organ in medical imaging), cross-modal fusion, and evaluation protocols that directly probe relational competence in structured vision tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Analysis and Detection of RIS-based Spoofing in Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18100v1)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is a key feature of next-generation 6G wireless systems, allowing them to achieve high data rates and sensing accuracy. While prior research has primarily focused on addressing communication safety in ISAC systems, the equally critical issue of sensing safety remains largely under-explored. In this paper, the possibility of spoofing the sensing function of ISAC in vehicle networks is examined, whereby a malicious reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is deployed to compromise the sensing functionality of a roadside unit (RSU). For this scenario, the requirements on the malicious RIS' phase shifts design and number of reflecting elements are analyzed. Under such spoofing, the practical estimation bias of the vehicular user (VU)'s Doppler shift and angle-of-departure (AoD) for an arbitrary time slot is analytically derived. Moreover, from the attacker's view, a Markov decision process (MDP) is formulated to optimize the RIS' phase shifts design. The goal of this MDP is to generate complete and plausible fake trajectories by incorporating the concept of spatial-temporal consistency. To defend against this sensing spoofing attack, a signal temporal logic (STL)-based neuro-symbolic attack detection framework is proposed and shown to learn interoperable formulas for identifying spoofed trajectories.</p></details> |  |

It is motivated by the fact that HOI is crucial for human-centric video content understanding. To solve ST-HOID, we propose a novel method consisting of an object trajectory detection module and an interaction reasoning module. Furthermore, we construct the first dataset named VidOR-HOID for ST-HOID evaluation, which contains 10,831 spatial-temporal HOI instances. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of our method. The experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the baselines generated by the state-of-the-art methods of image human-object interaction detection, video visual relation detection and video human-object interaction recognition.</p></details> |  |

However, as a typical complex network, data-driven deep learning is still in its infancy in describing and analyzing the resilience of complex networks, and its core is the lack of a theoretical framework to describe the system dynamics. In this paper, we propose a physically informative neural symbolic approach to describe the evolutionary dynamics of complex networks for resilient prediction. The core idea is to learn the dynamics of the activity state of physical entities and integrate it into the multi-layer spatiotemporal co-evolution network, and use the physical information method to realize the joint learning of physical symbol dynamics and spatiotemporal co-evolution topology, so as to predict the industrial chain resilience. The experimental results show that the model can obtain better results and predict the elasticity of the industry chain more accurately and effectively, which has certain practical significance for the development of the industry.</p></details> |  |
| **[MuST2-Learn: Multi-view Spatial-Temporal-Type Learning for Heterogeneous Municipal Service Time Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16503v1)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Non-emergency municipal services such as city 311 systems have been widely implemented across cities in Canada and the United States to enhance residents' quality of life. These systems enable residents to report issues, e.g., noise complaints, missed garbage collection, and potholes, via phone calls, mobile applications, or webpages. However, residents are often given limited information about when their service requests will be addressed, which can reduce transparency, lower resident satisfaction, and increase the number of follow-up inquiries. Predicting the service time for municipal service requests is challenging due to several complex factors: dynamic spatial-temporal correlations, underlying interactions among heterogeneous service request types, and high variation in service duration even within the same request category. In this work, we propose MuST2-Learn: a Multi-view Spatial-Temporal-Type Learning framework designed to address the aforementioned challenges by jointly modeling spatial, temporal, and service type dimensions. In detail, it incorporates an inter-type encoder to capture relationships among heterogeneous service request types and an intra-type variation encoder to model service time variation within homogeneous types. In addition, a spatiotemporal encoder is integrated to capture spatial and temporal correlations in each request type. The proposed framework is evaluated with extensive experiments using two real-world datasets. The results show that MuST2-Learn reduces mean absolute error by at least 32.5%, which outperforms state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to SIGSPATIAL 2025</p></details> |

Successful utilisation of micromobilities requires optimisation of complex systems for efficiency, environmental impact mitigation, and overcoming technical challenges for user safety. Machine Learning (ML) methods have been crucial to support these advancements and to address their unique challenges. However, there is insufficient literature addressing the specific issues of ML applications in micromobilities. This survey paper addresses this gap by providing a comprehensive review of datasets, ML techniques, and their specific applications in micromobilities. Specifically, we collect and analyse various micromobility-related datasets and discuss them in terms of spatial, temporal, and feature-based characteristics. In addition, we provide a detailed overview of ML models applied in micromobilities, introducing their advantages, challenges, and specific use cases. Furthermore, we explore multiple ML applications, such as demand prediction, energy management, and safety, focusing on improving efficiency, accuracy, and user experience. Finally, we propose future research directions to address these issues, aiming to help future researchers better understand this field.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 3 tables, and 4 figures, submitted to IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles</p></details> |

However, existing generation works predominantly concentrate on the creation of static scenes or narrow perspective-view dynamic scenes, falling short of delivering a truly 360-degree immersive experience from any viewpoint. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{TiP4GEN}, an advanced text-to-dynamic panorama scene generation framework that enables fine-grained content control and synthesizes motion-rich, geometry-consistent panoramic 4D scenes. TiP4GEN integrates panorama video generation and dynamic scene reconstruction to create 360-degree immersive virtual environments. For video generation, we introduce a \textbf{Dual-branch Generation Model} consisting of a panorama branch and a perspective branch, responsible for global and local view generation, respectively. A bidirectional cross-attention mechanism facilitates comprehensive information exchange between the branches. For scene reconstruction, we propose a \textbf{Geometry-aligned Reconstruction Model} based on 3D Gaussian Splatting. By aligning spatial-temporal point clouds using metric depth maps and initializing scene cameras with estimated poses, our method ensures geometric consistency and temporal coherence for the reconstructed scenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed designs and the superiority of TiP4GEN in generating visually compelling and motion-coherent dynamic panoramic scenes.

This paper presents a novel deep learning model, the Spatial-Temporal Unified Graph Attention Network (STGAtt). By leveraging a unified graph representation and an attention mechanism, STGAtt effectively captures complex spatial-temporal dependencies. Unlike methods relying on separate spatial and temporal dependency modeling modules, STGAtt directly models correlations within a Spatial-Temporal Unified Graph, dynamically weighing connections across both dimensions. To further enhance its capabilities, STGAtt partitions traffic flow observation signal into neighborhood subsets and employs a novel exchanging mechanism, enabling effective capture of both short-range and long-range correlations. Extensive experiments on the PEMS-BAY and SHMetro datasets demonstrate STGAtt's superior performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines across various prediction horizons. Visualization of attention weights confirms STGAtt's ability to adapt to dynamic traffic patterns and capture long-range dependencies, highlighting its potential for real-world traffic flow forecasting applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploring Spatial-Temporal Dynamics in Event-based Facial Micro-Expression Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11988v2)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Micro-expression analysis has applications in domains such as Human-Robot Interaction and Driver Monitoring Systems. Accurately capturing subtle and fast facial movements remains difficult when relying solely on RGB cameras, due to limitations in temporal resolution and sensitivity to motion blur. Event cameras offer an alternative, with microsecond-level precision, high dynamic range, and low latency. However, public datasets featuring event-based recordings of Action Units are still scarce. In this work, we introduce a novel, preliminary multi-resolution and multi-modal micro-expression dataset recorded with synchronized RGB and event cameras under variable lighting conditions. Two baseline tasks are evaluated to explore the spatial-temporal dynamics of micro-expressions: Action Unit classification using Spiking Neural Networks (51.23\% accuracy with events vs. 23.12\% with RGB), and frame reconstruction using Conditional Variational Autoencoders, achieving SSIM = 0.8513 and PSNR = 26.89 dB with high-resolution event input. These promising results show that event-based data can be used for micro-expression recognition and frame reconstruction.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Empirical Study on How Video-LLMs Answer Video Questions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15360v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Taking advantage of large-scale data and pretrained language models, Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) have shown strong capabilities in answering video questions. However, most existing efforts focus on improving performance, with limited attention to understanding their internal mechanisms. This paper aims to bridge this gap through a systematic empirical study. To interpret existing VideoLLMs, we adopt attention knockouts as our primary analytical tool and design three variants: Video Temporal Knockout, Video Spatial Knockout, and Language-to-Video Knockout. Then, we apply these three knockouts on different numbers of layers (window of layers). By carefully controlling the window of layers and types of knockouts, we provide two settings: a global setting and a fine-grained setting. Our study reveals three key findings: (1) Global setting indicates Video information extraction primarily occurs in early layers, forming a clear two-stage process -- lower layers focus on perceptual encoding, while higher layers handle abstract reasoning; (2) In the fine-grained setting, certain intermediate layers exert an outsized impact on video question answering, acting as critical outliers, whereas most other layers contribute minimally; (3) In both settings, we observe that spatial-temporal modeling relies more on language-guided retrieval than on intra- and inter-frame self-attention among video tokens, despite the latter's high computational cost. Finally, we demonstrate that these insights can be leveraged to reduce attention computation in Video-LLMs. To our knowledge, this is the first work to systematically uncover how Video-LLMs internally process and understand video content, offering interpretability and efficiency perspectives for future research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Tinker: Diffusion's Gift to 3D--Multi-View Consistent Editing From Sparse Inputs without Per-Scene Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14811v1)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Tinker, a versatile framework for high-fidelity 3D editing that operates in both one-shot and few-shot regimes without any per-scene finetuning. Unlike prior techniques that demand extensive per-scene optimization to ensure multi-view consistency or to produce dozens of consistent edited input views, Tinker delivers robust, multi-view consistent edits from as few as one or two images. This capability stems from repurposing pretrained diffusion models, which unlocks their latent 3D awareness. To drive research in this space, we curate the first large-scale multi-view editing dataset and data pipeline, spanning diverse scenes and styles. Building on this dataset, we develop our framework capable of generating multi-view consistent edited views without per-scene training, which consists of two novel components: (1) Referring multi-view editor: Enables precise, reference-driven edits that remain coherent across all viewpoints. (2) Any-view-to-video synthesizer: Leverages spatial-temporal priors from video diffusion to perform high-quality scene completion and novel-view generation even from sparse inputs. Through extensive experiments, Tinker significantly reduces the barrier to generalizable 3D content creation, achieving state-of-the-art performance on editing, novel-view synthesis, and rendering enhancement tasks. We believe that Tinker represents a key step towards truly scalable, zero-shot 3D editing.

To address these challenges, we present TRUST-Planner, a topology-guided hierarchical planning framework for robust spatial-temporal obstacle avoidance. In the frontend, a dynamic enhanced visible probabilistic roadmap (DEV-PRM) is proposed to rapidly explore topological paths for global guidance. The backend utilizes a uniform terminal-free minimum control polynomial (UTF-MINCO) and dynamic distance field (DDF) to enable efficient predictive obstacle avoidance and fast parallel computation. Furthermore, an incremental multi-branch trajectory management framework is introduced to enable spatio-temporal topological decision-making, while efficiently leveraging historical information to reduce replanning time. Simulation results show that TRUST-Planner outperforms baseline competitors, achieving a 96\% success rate and millisecond-level computation efficiency in tested complex environments. Real-world experiments further validate the feasibility and practicality of the proposed method.</p></details> |  |
| **[UST-SSM: Unified Spatio-Temporal State Space Models for Point Cloud Video Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14604v1)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Point cloud videos capture dynamic 3D motion while reducing the effects of lighting and viewpoint variations, making them highly effective for recognizing subtle and continuous human actions. Although Selective State Space Models (SSMs) have shown good performance in sequence modeling with linear complexity, the spatio-temporal disorder of point cloud videos hinders their unidirectional modeling when directly unfolding the point cloud video into a 1D sequence through temporally sequential scanning. To address this challenge, we propose the Unified Spatio-Temporal State Space Model (UST-SSM), which extends the latest advancements in SSMs to point cloud videos. Specifically, we introduce Spatial-Temporal Selection Scanning (STSS), which reorganizes unordered points into semantic-aware sequences through prompt-guided clustering, thereby enabling the effective utilization of points that are spatially and temporally distant yet similar within the sequence. For missing 4D geometric and motion details, Spatio-Temporal Structure Aggregation (STSA) aggregates spatio-temporal features and compensates. To improve temporal interaction within the sampled sequence, Temporal Interaction Sampling (TIS) enhances fine-grained temporal dependencies through non-anchor frame utilization and expanded receptive fields. Experimental results on the MSR-Action3D, NTU RGB+D, and Synthia 4D datasets validate the effectiveness of our method.

This paper specifically focuses on a subset of body actions known as micro-actions, which are subtle, low-intensity body movements with promising applications in human emotion analysis. In real-world scenarios, human micro-actions often temporally co-occur, with multiple micro-actions overlapping in time, such as concurrent head and hand movements. However, current research primarily focuses on recognizing individual micro-actions while overlooking their co-occurring nature. To address this gap, we propose a new task named Multi-label Micro-Action Detection (MMAD), which involves identifying all micro-actions in a given short video, determining their start and end times, and categorizing them. Accomplishing this requires a model capable of accurately capturing both long-term and short-term action relationships to detect multiple overlapping micro-actions. To facilitate the MMAD task, we introduce a new dataset named Multi-label Micro-Action-52 (MMA-52) and propose a baseline method equipped with a dual-path spatial-temporal adapter to address the challenges of subtle visual change in MMAD. We hope that MMA-52 can stimulate research on micro-action analysis in videos and prompt the development of spatio-temporal modeling in human-centric video understanding. The proposed MMA-52 dataset is available at: https://github.com/VUT-HFUT/Micro-Action.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> |
| **[Spatial-Temporal Transformer with Curriculum Learning for EEG-Based Emotion Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14698v2)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>EEG-based emotion recognition plays an important role in developing adaptive brain-computer communication systems, yet faces two fundamental challenges in practical implementations: (1) effective integration of non-stationary spatial-temporal neural patterns, (2) robust adaptation to dynamic emotional intensity variations in real-world scenarios. This paper proposes SST-CL, a novel framework integrating spatial-temporal transformers with curriculum learning. Our method introduces two core components: a spatial encoder that models inter-channel relationships and a temporal encoder that captures multi-scale dependencies through windowed attention mechanisms, enabling simultaneous extraction of spatial correlations and temporal dynamics from EEG signals. Complementing this architecture, an intensity-aware curriculum learning strategy progressively guides training from high-intensity to low-intensity emotional states through dynamic sample scheduling based on a dual difficulty assessment. Comprehensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across various emotional intensity levels, with ablation studies confirming the necessity of both architectural components and the curriculum learning mechanism.</p></details> |  |
| **[Where to Go Next Day: Multi-scale Spatial-Temporal Decoupled Model for Mid-term Human Mobility Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06561v2)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting individual mobility patterns is crucial across various applications. While current methods mainly focus on predicting the next location for personalized services like recommendations, they often fall short in supporting broader applications such as traffic management and epidemic control, which require longer period forecasts of human mobility. This study addresses mid-term mobility prediction, aiming to capture daily travel patterns and forecast trajectories for the upcoming day or week. We propose a novel Multi-scale Spatial-Temporal Decoupled Predictor (MSTDP) designed to efficiently extract spatial and temporal information by decoupling daily trajectories into distinct location-duration chains. Our approach employs a hierarchical encoder to model multi-scale temporal patterns, including daily recurrence and weekly periodicity, and utilizes a transformer-based decoder to globally attend to predicted information in the location or duration chain. Additionally, we introduce a spatial heterogeneous graph learner to capture multi-scale spatial relationships, enhancing semantic-rich representations. Extensive experiments, including statistical physics analysis, are conducted on large-scale mobile phone records in five cities (Boston, Los Angeles, SF Bay Area, Shanghai, and Tokyo), to demonstrate MSTDP's advantages. Applied to epidemic modeling in Boston, MSTDP significantly outperforms the best-performing baseline, achieving a remarkable 62.8% reduction in MAE for cumulative new cases.</p></details> |  |
| **[STAS: Spatio-Temporal Adaptive Computation Time for Spiking Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14138v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spiking neural networks (SNNs) offer energy efficiency over artificial neural networks (ANNs) but suffer from high latency and computational overhead due to their multi-timestep operational nature. While various dynamic computation methods have been developed to mitigate this by targeting spatial, temporal, or architecture-specific redundancies, they remain fragmented. While the principles of adaptive computation time (ACT) offer a robust foundation for a unified approach, its application to SNN-based vision Transformers (ViTs) is hindered by two core issues: the violation of its temporal similarity prerequisite and a static architecture fundamentally unsuited for its principles. To address these challenges, we propose STAS (Spatio-Temporal Adaptive computation time for Spiking transformers), a framework that co-designs the static architecture and dynamic computation policy. STAS introduces an integrated spike patch splitting (I-SPS) module to establish temporal stability by creating a unified input representation, thereby solving the architectural problem of temporal dissimilarity. This stability, in turn, allows our adaptive spiking self-attention (A-SSA) module to perform two-dimensional token pruning across both spatial and temporal axes. Implemented on spiking Transformer architectures and validated on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet, STAS reduces energy consumption by up to 45.9%, 43.8%, and 30.1%, respectively, while simultaneously improving accuracy over SOTA models.</p></details> | 8 pages |

However, existing methods often suffer from imprecise sensor calibration, leading to feature misalignment in LiDAR-camera BEV fusion. Moreover, such inaccuracies cause errors in depth estimation for the camera branch, aggravating misalignment between LiDAR and camera BEV features. In this work, we propose a novel ContrastAlign approach that utilizes contrastive learning to enhance the alignment of heterogeneous modalities, thereby improving the robustness of the fusion process. Specifically, our approach comprises three key components: (1) the L-Instance module, which extracts LiDAR instance features within the LiDAR BEV features; (2) the C-Instance module, which predicts camera instance features through Region of Interest (RoI) pooling on the camera BEV features; (3) the InstanceFusion module, which employs contrastive learning to generate consistent instance features across heFterogeneous modalities. Subsequently, we use graph matching to calculate the similarity between the neighboring camera instance features and the similarity instance features to complete the alignment of instance features. Our method achieves SOTA performance, with an mAP of 71.5%, surpassing GraphBEV by 1.4% on the nuScenes val set. Importantly, our method excels BEVFusion under conditions with spatial & temporal misalignment noise, improving mAP by 1.4% and 11.1% on nuScenes dataset. Notably, on the Argoverse2 dataset, ContrastAlign outperforms GraphBEV by 1.0% in mAP, indicating that the farther the distance, the more severe the feature misalignment and the more effective.</p></details> | 12 pages, 3 figures |
| **[ROVER: Robust Loop Closure Verification with Trajectory Prior in Repetitive Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13488v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Loop closure detection is important for simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), which associates current observations with historical keyframes, achieving drift correction and global relocalization. However, a falsely detected loop can be fatal, and this is especially difficult in repetitive environments where appearance-based features fail due to the high similarity. Therefore, verification of a loop closure is a critical step in avoiding false positive detections. Existing works in loop closure verification predominantly focus on learning invariant appearance features, neglecting the prior knowledge of the robot's spatial-temporal motion cue, i.e., trajectory. In this letter, we propose ROVER, a loop closure verification method that leverages the historical trajectory as a prior constraint to reject false loops in challenging repetitive environments. For each loop candidate, it is first used to estimate the robot trajectory with pose-graph optimization. This trajectory is then submitted to a scoring scheme that assesses its compliance with the trajectory without the loop, which we refer to as the trajectory prior, to determine if the loop candidate should be accepted. Benchmark comparisons and real-world experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Furthermore, we integrate ROVER into state-of-the-art SLAM systems to verify its robustness and efficiency. Our source code and self-collected dataset are available at https://github.com/jarvisyjw/ROVER.</p></details> | 8 pages, 9 figures |

Although Transformer-based models offer strong global modeling, they often struggle with rigid temporal encoding and weak space-time fusion. We propose STPFormer, a Spatio-Temporal Pattern-Aware Transformer that achieves state-of-the-art performance via unified and interpretable representation learning. It integrates four modules: Temporal Position Aggregator (TPA) for pattern-aware temporal encoding, Spatial Sequence Aggregator (SSA) for sequential spatial learning, Spatial-Temporal Graph Matching (STGM) for cross-domain alignment, and an Attention Mixer for multi-scale fusion. Experiments on five real-world datasets show that STPFormer consistently sets new SOTA results, with ablation and visualizations confirming its effectiveness and generalizability.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Maximum Coverage Model and Recommendation System for UAV Vertiports Location Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12651v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As urban aerial mobility (UAM) infrastructure development accelerates globally, cities like Shenzhen are planning large-scale vertiport networks (e.g., 1,200+ facilities by 2026). Existing planning frameworks remain inadequate for this complexity due to historical limitations in data granularity and real-world applicability. This paper addresses these gaps by first proposing the Capacitated Dynamic Maximum Covering Location Problem (CDMCLP), a novel optimization framework that simultaneously models urban-scale spatial-temporal demand, heterogeneous user behaviors, and infrastructure capacity constraints. Building on this foundation, we introduce an Integrated Planning Recommendation System that combines CDMCLP with socio-economic factors and dynamic clustering initialization. This system leverages adaptive parameter tuning based on empirical user behavior to generate practical planning solutions. Validation in a Chinese center city demonstrates the effectiveness of the new optimization framework and recommendation system. Under the evaluation and optimization of CDMCLP, the quantitative performance of traditional location methods are exposed and can be improved by 38\%--52\%, while the recommendation system shows user-friendliness and the effective integration of complex elements. By integrating mathematical rigor with practical implementation considerations, this hybrid approach bridges the gap between theoretical location modeling and real-world UAM infrastructure planning, offering municipalities a pragmatic tool for vertiport network design.</p></details> | 10 pages |

However, their potential for spatial modeling in multivariate time-series forecasting remains largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce a brand new SNN architecture, which is among the first to seamlessly integrate graph structural learning with spike-based temporal processing for multivariate time-series forecasting. Specifically, we first embed time features and an adaptive matrix, eliminating the need for predefined graph structures. We then further learn sequence features through the Observation (OBS) Block. Building upon this, our Multi-Scale Spike Aggregation (MSSA) hierarchically aggregates neighborhood information through spiking SAGE layers, enabling multi-hop feature extraction while eliminating the need for floating-point operations. Finally, we propose a Dual-Path Spike Fusion (DSF) Block to integrate spatial graph features and temporal dynamics via a spike-gated mechanism, combining LSTM-processed sequences with spiking self-attention outputs, effectively improve the model accuracy of long sequence datasets. Experiments show that our model surpasses the state-of-the-art SNN-based iSpikformer on all datasets and outperforms traditional temporal models at long horizons, thereby establishing a new paradigm for efficient spatial-temporal modeling.</p></details> | 9 pages, 4 figures |

While existing models excel at predicting human movement patterns, it remains unobvious how much they can interpret the underlying reasons or semantic meaning of those patterns. MobQA provides a comprehensive evaluation framework for LLMs to answer questions about diverse human GPS trajectories spanning daily to weekly granularities. It comprises 5,800 high-quality question-answer pairs across three complementary question types: factual retrieval (precise data extraction), multiple-choice reasoning (semantic inference), and free-form explanation (interpretive description), which all require spatial, temporal, and semantic reasoning. Our evaluation of major LLMs reveals strong performance on factual retrieval but significant limitations in semantic reasoning and explanation question answering, with trajectory length substantially impacting model effectiveness. These findings demonstrate the achievements and limitations of state-of-the-art LLMs for semantic mobility understanding.\footnote{MobQA dataset is available at https://github.com/CyberAgentAILab/mobqa.}</p></details> | 23 pages, 12 figures |

By designing a system where users follow this specific movement pattern, we enable robust extraction of facial volume information through neural optical flow estimation, significantly improving discrimination between genuine faces and various presentation attacks (including printed photos, screen displays, masks, and video replays). Our method processes both the predicted optical flows and RGB frames through a neural classifier, effectively leveraging spatial-temporal features for more reliable liveness detection compared to passive methods.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods in Micro-Action Recognition often overlook the inherent subtle changes in MAs, which limits the accuracy of distinguishing MAs with subtle changes. To address this issue, we present a novel Motion-guided Modulation Network (MMN) that implicitly captures and modulates subtle motion cues to enhance spatial-temporal representation learning. Specifically, we introduce a Motion-guided Skeletal Modulation module (MSM) to inject motion cues at the skeletal level, acting as a control signal to guide spatial representation modeling. In parallel, we design a Motion-guided Temporal Modulation module (MTM) to incorporate motion information at the frame level, facilitating the modeling of holistic motion patterns in micro-actions. Finally, we propose a motion consistency learning strategy to aggregate the motion cues from multi-scale features for micro-action classification. Experimental results on the Micro-Action 52 and iMiGUE datasets demonstrate that MMN achieves state-of-the-art performance in skeleton-based micro-action recognition, underscoring the importance of explicitly modeling subtle motion cues.

While early research focused on unconditional sampling, practitioners now demand controllable generation that allows precise specification of layout, pose, motion, or style. While ControlNet grants precise spatial-temporal control, its auxiliary branch markedly increases latency and introduces redundant computation in both uncontrolled regions and denoising steps, especially for video. To address this problem, we introduce EVCtrl, a lightweight, plug-and-play control adapter that slashes overhead without retraining the model. Specifically, we propose a spatio-temporal dual caching strategy for sparse control information. For spatial redundancy, we first profile how each layer of DiT-ControlNet responds to fine-grained control, then partition the network into global and local functional zones. A locality-aware cache focuses computation on the local zones that truly need the control signal, skipping the bulk of redundant computation in global regions. For temporal redundancy, we selectively omit unnecessary denoising steps to improve efficiency. Extensive experiments on CogVideo-Controlnet, Wan2.1-Controlnet, and Flux demonstrate that our method is effective in image and video control generation without the need for training. For example, it achieves 2.16 and 2.05 times speedups on CogVideo-Controlnet and Wan2.1-Controlnet, respectively, with almost no degradation in generation quality.Codes are available in the supplementary materials.</p></details> |  |

One such foundational model is Segment anything model (SAM), which can accurately segment objects in images.

However, a key challenge lies in the noisy and sparse nature of spatial-temporal data, which limits existing neural networks' ability to learn meaningful region representations in the spatial-temporal graph. To overcome these limitations, we propose HGAurban, a novel heterogeneous spatial-temporal graph masked autoencoder that leverages generative self-supervised learning for robust urban data representation. Our framework introduces a spatial-temporal heterogeneous graph encoder that extracts region-wise dependencies from multi-source data, enabling comprehensive modeling of diverse spatial relationships. Within our self-supervised learning paradigm, we implement a masked autoencoder that jointly processes node features and graph structure. This approach automatically learns heterogeneous spatial-temporal patterns across regions, significantly improving the representation of dynamic temporal correlations. Comprehensive experiments across multiple spatiotemporal mining tasks demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods and robustly handles real-world urban data challenges, including noise and sparsity in both spatial and temporal dimensions.</p></details> | 10 pages |
| **[Follow-Your-Motion: Video Motion Transfer via Efficient Spatial-Temporal Decoupled Finetuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05207v2)** | 2025-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, breakthroughs in the video diffusion transformer have shown remarkable capabilities in diverse motion generations. As for the motion-transfer task, current methods mainly use two-stage Low-Rank Adaptations (LoRAs) finetuning to obtain better performance. However, existing adaptation-based motion transfer still suffers from motion inconsistency and tuning inefficiency when applied to large video diffusion transformers. Naive two-stage LoRA tuning struggles to maintain motion consistency between generated and input videos due to the inherent spatial-temporal coupling in the 3D attention operator. Additionally, they require time-consuming fine-tuning processes in both stages. To tackle these issues, we propose Follow-Your-Motion, an efficient two-stage video motion transfer framework that finetunes a powerful video diffusion transformer to synthesize complex motion. Specifically, we propose a spatial-temporal decoupled LoRA to decouple the attention architecture for spatial appearance and temporal motion processing. During the second training stage, we design the sparse motion sampling and adaptive RoPE to accelerate the tuning speed. To address the lack of a benchmark for this field, we introduce MotionBench, a comprehensive benchmark comprising diverse motion, including creative camera motion, single object motion, multiple object motion, and complex human motion.

Although recent research has focused on enhancing spatial and temporal understanding independently, this paper presents a novel approach that integrates both aspects through visual prompting. We introduce a method that projects visual traces of key points from observations onto depth maps, enabling models to capture both spatial and temporal information simultaneously. The experiments in SimplerEnv show that the mean number of tasks successfully solved increased for 4% compared to SpatialVLA and 19% compared to TraceVLA. Furthermore, we show that this enhancement can be achieved with minimal training data, making it particularly valuable for real-world applications where data collection is challenging.

| **[Spatial-Temporal Multi-Scale Quantization for Flexible Motion Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08991v1)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite significant advancements in human motion generation, current motion representations, typically formulated as discrete frame sequences, still face two critical limitations: (i) they fail to capture motion from a multi-scale perspective, limiting the capability in complex patterns modeling; (ii) they lack compositional flexibility, which is crucial for model's generalization in diverse generation tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce MSQ, a novel quantization method that compresses the motion sequence into multi-scale discrete tokens across spatial and temporal dimensions. MSQ employs distinct encoders to capture body parts at varying spatial granularities and temporally interpolates the encoded features into multiple scales before quantizing them into discrete tokens. Building on this representation, we establish a generative mask modeling model to effectively support motion editing, motion control, and conditional motion generation. Through quantitative and qualitative analysis, we show that our quantization method enables the seamless composition of motion tokens without requiring specialized design or re-training. Furthermore, extensive evaluations demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing baseline methods on various benchmarks.</p></details> | 18 pages |

Despite advancements in video comprehension, the substantial computational demands of long video sequences lead current video LLMs (Vid-LLMs) to employ compression strategies at both the inter-frame level (e.g., uniform sampling of video frames) and intra-frame level (e.g., condensing all visual tokens of each frame into a limited number). However, this approach often neglects the uneven temporal distribution of critical information across frames, risking the omission of keyframes that contain essential temporal and semantic details. To tackle these challenges, we propose KFFocus, a method designed to efficiently compress video tokens and emphasize the informative context present within video frames. We substitute uniform sampling with a refined approach inspired by classic video compression principles to identify and capture keyframes based on their temporal redundancy. By assigning varying condensation ratios to frames based on their contextual relevance, KFFocus efficiently reduces token redundancy while preserving informative content details. Additionally, we introduce a spatiotemporal modeling module that encodes both the temporal relationships between video frames and the spatial structure within each frame, thus providing Vid-LLMs with a nuanced understanding of spatial-temporal dynamics. Extensive experiments on widely recognized video understanding benchmarks, especially long video scenarios, demonstrate that KFFocus significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving substantial computational efficiency and enhanced accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Disentangling Multiplex Spatial-Temporal Transition Graph Representation Learning for Socially Enhanced POI Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07649v1)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Next Point-of-Interest (POI) recommendation is a research hotspot in business intelligence, where users' spatial-temporal transitions and social relationships play key roles. However, most existing works model spatial and temporal transitions separately, leading to misaligned representations of the same spatial-temporal key nodes. This misalignment introduces redundant information during fusion, increasing model uncertainty and reducing interpretability. To address this issue, we propose DiMuST, a socially enhanced POI recommendation model based on disentangled representation learning over multiplex spatial-temporal transition graphs. The model employs a novel Disentangled variational multiplex graph Auto-Encoder (DAE), which first disentangles shared and private distributions using a multiplex spatial-temporal graph strategy. It then fuses the shared features via a Product of Experts (PoE) mechanism and denoises the private features through contrastive constraints. The model effectively captures the spatial-temporal transition representations of POIs while preserving the intrinsic correlation of their spatial-temporal relationships. Experiments on two challenging datasets demonstrate that our DiMuST significantly outperforms existing methods across multiple metrics.</p></details> |  |

To overcome these challenges, we introduce Splat4D, a novel framework enabling high-fidelity 4D content generation from a monocular video. Splat4D achieves superior performance while maintaining faithful spatial-temporal coherence by leveraging multi-view rendering, inconsistency identification, a video diffusion model, and an asymmetric U-Net for refinement. Through extensive evaluations on public benchmarks, Splat4D consistently demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across various metrics, underscoring the efficacy of our approach. Additionally, the versatility of Splat4D is validated in various applications such as text/image conditioned 4D generation, 4D human generation, and text-guided content editing, producing coherent outcomes following user instructions.</p></details> |  |

We begin by pretraining a powerful 2D character animation model based on a cutting-edge DiT-based image-to-video model, which allows for any 2D pose sequnce as controllable signal. We then lift the animation model from 2D to 3D through introducing dual-attention module together with camera prior to generate multi-view videos with spatial-temporal and spatial-view consistency. Finally, we employ a novel neighbor-constrained 4D gaussian splatting optimization on these multi-view videos, resulting in continuous and stable 4D character representations. Moreover, to improve character-centric performance, we construct a large-scale dataset Character4D, containing 13,115 unique characters with diverse appearances and motions, rendered from multiple viewpoints. Extensive experiments on our newly constructed benchmark, CharacterBench, demonstrate that our approach outperforms current state-of-the-art methods.

These functional connectivity dynamics may be related to behaviour and neuropsychiatric disease. To model these dynamics, temporal brain connectivity representations are essential, as they reflect evolving interactions between brain regions and provide insight into transient neural states and network reconfigurations. However, conventional graph neural networks (GNNs) often struggle to capture long-range temporal dependencies in dynamic fMRI data. To address this challenge, we propose BrainATCL, an unsupervised, nonparametric framework for adaptive temporal brain connectivity learning, enabling functional link prediction and age estimation. Our method dynamically adjusts the lookback window for each snapshot based on the rate of newly added edges. Graph sequences are subsequently encoded using a GINE-Mamba2 backbone to learn spatial-temporal representations of dynamic functional connectivity in resting-state fMRI data of 1,000 participants from the Human Connectome Project. To further improve spatial modeling, we incorporate brain structure and function-informed edge attributes, i.e., the left/right hemispheric identity and subnetwork membership of brain regions, enabling the model to capture biologically meaningful topological patterns. We evaluate our BrainATCL on two tasks: functional link prediction and age estimation. The experimental results demonstrate superior performance and strong generalization, including in cross-session prediction scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[StarPose: 3D Human Pose Estimation via Spatial-Temporal Autoregressive Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02056v2)** | 2025-08-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Monocular 3D human pose estimation remains a challenging task due to inherent depth ambiguities and occlusions. Compared to traditional methods based on Transformers or Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), recent diffusion-based approaches have shown superior performance, leveraging their probabilistic nature and high-fidelity generation capabilities. However, these methods often fail to account for the spatial and temporal correlations across predicted frames, resulting in limited temporal consistency and inferior accuracy in predicted 3D pose sequences. To address these shortcomings, this paper proposes StarPose, an autoregressive diffusion framework that effectively incorporates historical 3D pose predictions and spatial-temporal physical guidance to significantly enhance both the accuracy and temporal coherence of pose predictions. Unlike existing approaches, StarPose models the 2D-to-3D pose mapping as an autoregressive diffusion process. By synergically integrating previously predicted 3D poses with 2D pose inputs via a Historical Pose Integration Module (HPIM), the framework generates rich and informative historical pose embeddings that guide subsequent denoising steps, ensuring temporally consistent predictions. In addition, a fully plug-and-play Spatial-Temporal Physical Guidance (STPG) mechanism is tailored to refine the denoising process in an iterative manner, which further enforces spatial anatomical plausibility and temporal motion dynamics, rendering robust and realistic pose estimates. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that StarPose outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior accuracy and temporal consistency in 3D human pose estimation.

| **[Zero-Shot Cellular Trajectory Map Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06674v1)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cellular Trajectory Map-Matching (CTMM) aims to align cellular location sequences to road networks, which is a necessary preprocessing in location-based services on web platforms like Google Maps, including navigation and route optimization. Current approaches mainly rely on ID-based features and region-specific data to learn correlations between cell towers and roads, limiting their adaptability to unexplored areas. To enable high-accuracy CTMM without additional training in target regions, Zero-shot CTMM requires to extract not only region-adaptive features, but also sequential and location uncertainty to alleviate positioning errors in cellular data. In this paper, we propose a pixel-based trajectory calibration assistant for zero-shot CTMM, which takes advantage of transferable geospatial knowledge to calibrate pixelated trajectory, and then guide the path-finding process at the road network level. To enhance knowledge sharing across similar regions, a Gaussian mixture model is incorporated into VAE, enabling the identification of scenario-adaptive experts through soft clustering. To mitigate high positioning errors, a spatial-temporal awareness module is designed to capture sequential features and location uncertainty, thereby facilitating the inference of approximate user positions. Finally, a constrained path-finding algorithm is employed to reconstruct the road ID sequence, ensuring topological validity within the road network. This process is guided by the calibrated trajectory while optimizing for the shortest feasible path, thus minimizing unnecessary detours. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms existing methods in zero-shot CTMM by 16.8\%.</p></details> |  |

At its core, GE-Base is a large-scale, instruction-conditioned video diffusion model that captures the spatial, temporal, and semantic dynamics of real-world robotic interactions in a structured latent space. Built upon this foundation, GE-Act maps latent representations to executable action trajectories through a lightweight, flow-matching decoder, enabling precise and generalizable policy inference across diverse embodiments with minimal supervision. To support scalable evaluation and training, GE-Sim serves as an action-conditioned neural simulator, producing high-fidelity rollouts for closed-loop policy development.

Existing detection approaches often fail to generalize across diverse manipulation types due to their reliance on isolated spatial, temporal, or spectral information, and typically require large models to perform well. This paper introduces SSTGNN, a lightweight Spatial-Spectral-Temporal Graph Neural Network framework that represents videos as structured graphs, enabling joint reasoning over spatial inconsistencies, temporal artifacts, and spectral distortions. SSTGNN incorporates learnable spectral filters and temporal differential modeling into a graph-based architecture, capturing subtle manipulation traces more effectively. Extensive experiments on diverse benchmark datasets demonstrate that SSTGNN not only achieves superior performance in both in-domain and cross-domain settings, but also offers strong robustness against unseen manipulations. Remarkably, SSTGNN accomplishes these results with up to 42.4$\times$ fewer parameters than state-of-the-art models, making it highly lightweight and scalable for real-world deployment.</p></details> | 11 pages |

Grounded in cognitive neuroscience, it integrates four core modules: the Information Preprocessor (thalamus-like), the Lifelong Embodied Memory System (hippocampus-like), the Closed-Loop Planning Module (prefrontal lobe-like), and the Low-Level Executer (cerebellum-like) to enable long-term planning and cumulative learning. The Lifelong Embodied Memory System, central to the framework, alleviates inference speed issues in complex memory frameworks via parallelized updates/retrieval across Spatial, Temporal, Episodic, and Semantic submodules. It incorporates a dynamic Knowledge Graph (KG) and consistent architectural design to enhance memory consistency and scalability. Evaluations on EmbodiedBench show RoboMemory outperforms the open-source baseline (Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Ins) by 25% in average success rate and surpasses the closed-source State-of-the-Art (SOTA) (Claude3.5-Sonnet) by 5%, establishing new SOTA. Ablation studies validate key components (critic, spatial memory, long-term memory), while real-world deployment confirms its lifelong learning capability with significantly improved success rates across repeated tasks. RoboMemory alleviates high latency challenges with scalability, serving as a foundational reference for integrating multi-modal memory systems in physical robots.</p></details> |  |

Eye Tracking-Based Modeling of Situational Awareness in Augmented Reality](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05025v1)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Augmented Reality (AR) systems, while enhancing task performance through real-time guidance, pose risks of inducing cognitive tunneling-a hyperfocus on virtual content that compromises situational awareness (SA) in safety-critical scenarios. This paper investigates SA in AR-guided cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), where responders must balance effective compressions with vigilance to unpredictable hazards (e.g., patient vomiting). We developed an AR app on a Magic Leap 2 that overlays real-time CPR feedback (compression depth and rate) and conducted a user study with simulated unexpected incidents (e.g., bleeding) to evaluate SA, in which SA metrics were collected via observation and questionnaires administered during freeze-probe events. Eye tracking analysis revealed that higher SA levels were associated with greater saccadic amplitude and velocity, and with reduced proportion and frequency of fixations on virtual content. To predict SA, we propose FixGraphPool, a graph neural network that structures gaze events (fixations, saccades) into spatiotemporal graphs, effectively capturing dynamic attentional patterns. Our model achieved 83.0% accuracy (F1=81.0%), outperforming feature-based machine learning and state-of-the-art time-series models by leveraging domain knowledge and spatial-temporal information encoded in ET data. These findings demonstrate the potential of eye tracking for SA modeling in AR and highlight its utility in designing AR systems that ensure user safety and situational awareness.</p></details> |  |

This computing paradigm can not only achieve intrinsic parallelism like existing works by the exploration of an exponential number of possibilities simultaneously with very small number of hardware units, but also extend this unique characteristic to a multidimensional space including spatial, temporal and frequency domains, making it particularly effective for addressing NP-hard problems. The proposed architecture has been validated through SPICE simulations, demonstrating its potential capability in solving several NP-hard problems, such as the Number Partitioning Problem, the 0/1 Knapsack Problem, and the Traveling Salesman Problem.</p></details> | 20 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Uncertainty-aware Predict-Then-Optimize Framework for Equitable Post-Disaster Power Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04780v1)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing frequency of extreme weather events, such as hurricanes, highlights the urgent need for efficient and equitable power system restoration. Many electricity providers make restoration decisions primarily based on the volume of power restoration requests from each region. However, our data-driven analysis reveals significant disparities in request submission volume, as disadvantaged communities tend to submit fewer restoration requests. This disparity makes the current restoration solution inequitable, leaving these communities vulnerable to extended power outages. To address this, we aim to propose an equity-aware power restoration strategy that balances both restoration efficiency and equity across communities. However, achieving this goal is challenging for two reasons: the difficulty of predicting repair durations under dataset heteroscedasticity, and the tendency of reinforcement learning agents to favor low-uncertainty actions, which potentially undermine equity. To overcome these challenges, we design a predict-then-optimize framework called EPOPR with two key components: (1) Equity-Conformalized Quantile Regression for uncertainty-aware repair duration prediction, and (2) Spatial-Temporal Attentional RL that adapts to varying uncertainty levels across regions for equitable decision-making. Experimental results show that our EPOPR effectively reduces the average power outage duration by 3.60% and decreases inequity between different communities by 14.19% compared to state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> | 9 pages,12 figures |

Traditional far-field beam training methods become inadequate, while near-field training faces the challenge of large codebooks due to the need to resolve both angular and distance domains. To reduce in-band training overhead, prior work has proposed to leverage the spatial-temporal congruence between sub-6 GHz (sub-6G) and mmWave channels to predict the best mmWave beam within a near-field codebook from sub-6G channel estimates. To cope with the uncertainty caused by sub-6G/mmWave differences, we introduce a novel Sub-6G Channel Aided Near-field BEam SelecTion (SCAN-BEST) framework that wraps around any beam predictor to produce candidate beam subset with formal suboptimality guarantees. The proposed SCAN-BEST builds on conformal risk control (CRC), and is calibrated offline using limited calibration data. Its performance guarantees apply even in the presence of statistical shifts between calibration and deployment. Numerical results validate the theoretical properties and efficiency of SCAN-BEST.</p></details> | 15 pages, 12 figures |

However, these systems often face challenges related to degraded data quality caused by sensor drift, noise, and insufficient calibration -- factors that limit their reliability in real-world applications. Traditional machine learning methods for sensor fusion and calibration rely on extensive feature engineering and struggle to capture spatial-temporal dependencies or adapt to distribution shifts across varying deployment conditions. To address these challenges, we propose a novel unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) method tailored for regression tasks. Our proposed method integrates effectively with Spatial-Temporal Graph Neural Networks and leverages the alignment of perturbed inverse Gram matrices between source and target domains, drawing inspiration from Tikhonov regularization. This approach enables scalable and efficient domain adaptation without requiring labeled data in the target domain. We validate our novel method on real-world datasets from two distinct applications: air quality monitoring and EEG signal reconstruction. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance which paves the way for more robust and transferable sensor fusion models in both environmental and physiological contexts.

Current red-teaming tools often rely on fixed benchmarks or unrealistic prompts, missing many real-world vulnerabilities. We present ASTRA, an automated agent system designed to systematically uncover safety flaws in AI-driven code generation and security guidance systems. ASTRA works in three stages: (1) it builds structured domain-specific knowledge graphs that model complex software tasks and known weaknesses; (2) it performs online vulnerability exploration of each target model by adaptively probing both its input space, i.e., the spatial exploration, and its reasoning processes, i.e., the temporal exploration, guided by the knowledge graphs; and (3) it generates high-quality violation-inducing cases to improve model alignment. Unlike prior methods, ASTRA focuses on realistic inputs-requests that developers might actually ask-and uses both offline abstraction guided domain modeling and online domain knowledge graph adaptation to surface corner-case vulnerabilities. Across two major evaluation domains, ASTRA finds 11-66% more issues than existing techniques and produces test cases that lead to 17% more effective alignment training, showing its practical value for building safer AI systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first two authors (Xiangzhe Xu and Guangyu Shen) contributed equally to this work</p></details> |

However, matching 3D motions with text remains highly challenging, primarily due to the intricate structure of human body and its spatial-temporal dynamics. Existing approaches often overlook these complexities, relying on general encoding methods that fail to distinguish different body parts and their dynamics, limiting precise semantic alignment. To address this, we propose WaMo, a novel wavelet-based multi-frequency feature extraction framework. It fully captures part-specific and time-varying motion details across multiple resolutions on body joints, extracting discriminative motion features to achieve fine-grained alignment with texts. WaMo has three key components: (1) Trajectory Wavelet Decomposition decomposes motion signals into frequency components that preserve both local kinematic details and global motion semantics. (2) Trajectory Wavelet Reconstruction uses learnable inverse wavelet transforms to reconstruct original joint trajectories from extracted features, ensuring the preservation of essential spatial-temporal information. (3) Disordered Motion Sequence Prediction reorders shuffled motion sequences to improve the learning of inherent temporal coherence, enhancing motion-text alignment. Extensive experiments demonstrate WaMo's superiority, achieving 17.0\% and 18.2\% improvements in $Rsum$ on HumanML3D and KIT-ML datasets, respectively, outperforming existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing approaches rely heavily on manual feature engineering or data transformation. While such techniques may provide benefits when working with small-scale datasets, they often lead to information loss and distortion when applied to large-scale data, ultimately limiting model performance. Moreover, the limited subject scale and demographic diversity of datasets used in prior studies hinder comprehensive evaluation of model robustness and generalizability, thus restricting their applicability in real-world clinical settings. To address these challenges, we propose ADformer, a novel multi-granularity spatial-temporal transformer designed to capture both temporal and spatial features from raw EEG signals, enabling effective end-to-end representation learning. Our model introduces multi-granularity embedding strategies across both spatial and temporal dimensions, leveraging a two-stage intra-inter granularity self-attention mechanism to learn both local patterns within each granularity and global dependencies across granularities. We evaluate ADformer on 4 large-scale datasets comprising a total of 1,713 subjects, representing one of the largest corpora for EEG-based AD detection to date, under a cross-validated, subject-independent setting. Experimental results demonstrate that ADformer consistently outperforms existing methods, achieving subject-level F1 scores of 92.82%, 89.83%, 67.99%, and 83.98% on the 4 datasets, respectively, in distinguishing AD from healthy control (HC) subjects.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work will be submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |
| **[OmniEvent: Unified Event Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01842v1)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Event cameras have gained increasing popularity in computer vision due to their ultra-high dynamic range and temporal resolution. However, event networks heavily rely on task-specific designs due to the unstructured data distribution and spatial-temporal (S-T) inhomogeneity, making it hard to reuse existing architectures for new tasks. We propose OmniEvent, the first unified event representation learning framework that achieves SOTA performance across diverse tasks, fully removing the need of task-specific designs. Unlike previous methods that treat event data as 3D point clouds with manually tuned S-T scaling weights, OmniEvent proposes a decouple-enhance-fuse paradigm, where the local feature aggregation and enhancement is done independently on the spatial and temporal domains to avoid inhomogeneity issues. Space-filling curves are applied to enable large receptive fields while improving memory and compute efficiency. The features from individual domains are then fused by attention to learn S-T interactions. The output of OmniEvent is a grid-shaped tensor, which enables standard vision models to process event data without architecture change. With a unified framework and similar hyper-parameters, OmniEvent out-performs (tasks-specific) SOTA by up to 68.2% across 3 representative tasks and 10 datasets (Fig.1). Code will be ready in https://github.com/Wickyan/OmniEvent .</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches model different body regions such as body, legs and hands separately, which fail to capture the spatial interactions between them and result in unnatural and disjointed movements. Additionally, their autoregressive/diffusion-based pipelines show slow generation speed due to dozens of inference steps. To address these two challenges, we propose GestureLSM, a flow-matching-based approach for Co-Speech Gesture Generation with spatial-temporal modeling. Our method i) explicitly model the interaction of tokenized body regions through spatial and temporal attention, for generating coherent full-body gestures. ii) introduce the flow matching to enable more efficient sampling by explicitly modeling the latent velocity space. To overcome the suboptimal performance of flow matching baseline, we propose latent shortcut learning and beta distribution time stamp sampling during training to enhance gesture synthesis quality and accelerate inference. Combining the spatial-temporal modeling and improved flow matching-based framework, GestureLSM achieves state-of-the-art performance on BEAT2 while significantly reducing inference time compared to existing methods, highlighting its potential for enhancing digital humans and embodied agents in real-world applications.

However, existing Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) methods for humanoid robots neglect morphological symmetry of the robot, leading to uncoordinated and suboptimal behaviors. Inspired by human motor control, we propose Symmetry Equivariant Policy (SE-Policy), a new DRL framework that embeds strict symmetry equivariance in the actor and symmetry invariance in the critic without additional hyperparameters. SE-Policy enforces consistent behaviors across symmetric observations, producing temporally and spatially coordinated motions with higher task performance. Extensive experiments on velocity tracking tasks, conducted in both simulation and real-world deployment with the Unitree G1 humanoid robot, demonstrate that SE-Policy improves tracking accuracy by up to 40% compared to state-of-the-art baselines, while achieving superior spatial-temporal coordination.

Classical closed-vocabulary MOT (CV-MOT) methods aim to track objects of predefined categories. Recently, some open-vocabulary MOT (OV-MOT) methods have successfully addressed the problem of tracking unknown categories. However, we found that the CV-MOT and OV-MOT methods each struggle to excel in the tasks of the other. In this paper, we present a unified framework, Associate Everything Detected (AED), that simultaneously tackles CV-MOT and OV-MOT by integrating with any off-the-shelf detector and supports unknown categories. Different from existing tracking-by-detection MOT methods, AED gets rid of prior knowledge (e.g. motion cues) and relies solely on highly robust feature learning to handle complex trajectories in OV-MOT tasks while keeping excellent performance in CV-MOT tasks. Specifically, we model the association task as a similarity decoding problem and propose a sim-decoder with an association-centric learning mechanism. The sim-decoder calculates similarities in three aspects: spatial, temporal, and cross-clip. Subsequently, association-centric learning leverages these threefold similarities to ensure that the extracted features are appropriate for continuous tracking and robust enough to generalize to unknown categories. Compared with existing powerful OV-MOT and CV-MOT methods, AED achieves superior performance on TAO, SportsMOT, and DanceTrack without any prior knowledge.

| **[Video Forgery Detection with Optical Flow Residuals and Spatial-Temporal Consistency](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00397v1)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of diffusion-based video generation models has led to increasingly realistic synthetic content, presenting new challenges for video forgery detection. Existing methods often struggle to capture fine-grained temporal inconsistencies, particularly in AI-generated videos with high visual fidelity and coherent motion. In this work, we propose a detection framework that leverages spatial-temporal consistency by combining RGB appearance features with optical flow residuals. The model adopts a dual-branch architecture, where one branch analyzes RGB frames to detect appearance-level artifacts, while the other processes flow residuals to reveal subtle motion anomalies caused by imperfect temporal synthesis. By integrating these complementary features, the proposed method effectively detects a wide range of forged videos. Extensive experiments on text-to-video and image-to-video tasks across ten diverse generative models demonstrate the robustness and strong generalization ability of the proposed approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatial-Temporal-Spectral Unified Modeling for Remote Sensing Dense Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12280v3)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The proliferation of multi-source remote sensing data has propelled the development of deep learning for dense prediction, yet significant challenges in data and task unification persist. Current deep learning architectures for remote sensing are fundamentally rigid. They are engineered for fixed input-output configurations, restricting their adaptability to the heterogeneous spatial, temporal, and spectral dimensions inherent in real-world data. Furthermore, these models neglect the intrinsic correlations among semantic segmentation, binary change detection, and semantic change detection, necessitating the development of distinct models or task-specific decoders. This paradigm is also constrained to a predefined set of output semantic classes, where any change to the classes requires costly retraining. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the Spatial-Temporal-Spectral Unified Network (STSUN) for unified modeling. STSUN can adapt to input and output data with arbitrary spatial sizes, temporal lengths, and spectral bands by leveraging their metadata for a unified representation. Moreover, STSUN unifies disparate dense prediction tasks within a single architecture by conditioning the model on trainable task embeddings. Similarly, STSUN facilitates flexible prediction across multiple set of semantic categories by integrating trainable category embeddings as metadata. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets with diverse Spatial-Temporal-Spectral configurations in multiple scenarios demonstrate that a single STSUN model effectively adapts to heterogeneous inputs and outputs, unifying various dense prediction tasks and diverse semantic class predictions. The proposed approach consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, highlighting its robustness and generalizability for complex remote sensing applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 6 figures, Code link:https://github.com/walking-shadow/Official_TSSUN</p></details> |
| **[CoST: Efficient Collaborative Perception From Unified Spatiotemporal Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00359v1)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Collaborative perception shares information among different agents and helps solving problems that individual agents may face, e.g., occlusions and small sensing range. Prior methods usually separate the multi-agent fusion and multi-time fusion into two consecutive steps. In contrast, this paper proposes an efficient collaborative perception that aggregates the observations from different agents (space) and different times into a unified spatio-temporal space simultanesouly. The unified spatio-temporal space brings two benefits, i.e., efficient feature transmission and superior feature fusion. 1) Efficient feature transmission: each static object yields a single observation in the spatial temporal space, and thus only requires transmission only once (whereas prior methods re-transmit all the object features multiple times). 2) superior feature fusion: merging the multi-agent and multi-time fusion into a unified spatial-temporal aggregation enables a more holistic perspective, thereby enhancing perception performance in challenging scenarios. Consequently, our Collaborative perception with Spatio-temporal Transformer (CoST) gains improvement in both efficiency and accuracy. Notably, CoST is not tied to any specific method and is compatible with a majority of previous methods, enhancing their accuracy while reducing the transmission bandwidth.</p></details> | ICCV25 (Highlight) |

Nevertheless, the telecom industry still heavily relies on manual expert intervention. Existing studies have been focused on exhaustively explore the spatial-temporal correlations. However, they often overlook the underlying characteristics of cellular traffic, which are shaped by the sporadic and bursty nature of telecom services. Additionally, concept drift creates substantial obstacles to maintaining satisfactory accuracy in continuous cellular forecasting tasks. To resolve these problems, we put forward an online cellular traffic prediction method grounded in Multi-Grained Spatial-Temporal feature Complementarity (MGSTC). The proposed method is devised to achieve high-precision predictions in practical continuous forecasting scenarios. Concretely, MGSTC segments historical data into chunks and employs the coarse-grained temporal attention to offer a trend reference for the prediction horizon. Subsequently, fine-grained spatial attention is utilized to capture detailed correlations among network elements, which enables localized refinement of the established trend. The complementarity of these multi-grained spatial-temporal features facilitates the efficient transmission of valuable information. To accommodate continuous forecasting needs, we implement an online learning strategy that can detect concept drift in real-time and promptly switch to the appropriate parameter update stage. Experiments carried out on four real-world datasets demonstrate that MGSTC outperforms eleven state-of-the-art baselines consistently.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in ACM TKDD. 26 pages, 12 figures,</p></details> |

| **[Identifying Unique Spatial-Temporal Bayesian Network without Markov Equivalence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.10085v4)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Identifying vanilla Bayesian network to model spatial-temporal causality can be a critical yet challenging task. Different Markovian-equivalent directed acyclic graphs would be identified if the identifiability is not satisfied. To address this issue, Directed Cyclic Graph is proposed to drop the directed acyclic constraint. But it does not always hold, and cannot model dynamical time-series process. Then, Full Time Graph is proposed with introducing high-order time delay. Full Time Graph has no Markov equivalence class by assuming no instantaneous effects. But, it also assumes that the causality is invariant with varying time, that is not always satisfied in the spatio-temporal scenarios. Thus, in this work, a Spatial-Temporal Bayesian Network (STBN) is proposed to theoretically model the spatial-temporal causality from the perspective of information transfer. STBN explains the disappearance of network structure $X\rightarrow Z \rightarrow Y$ and $X\leftarrow Z \leftarrow Y$ by the principle of information path blocking. And finally, the uniqueness of STBN is proved. Based on this, a High-order Causal Entropy (HCE) algorithm is also proposed to uniquely identify STBN under time complexity $\mathcal{O}(n^3\tau_{max})$, where $n$ is the number of variables and $\tau_{max}$ is the maximum time delay. Numerical experiments are conducted with comparison to other baseline algorithms. The results show that HCE algorithm obtains state-of-the-art identification accuracy.

| **[Spatial-Temporal Reinforcement Learning for Network Routing with Non-Markovian Traffic](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22174v2)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning (RL) has been widely used for packet routing in communication networks, but traditional RL methods rely on the Markov assumption that the current state contains all necessary information for decision-making. In reality, internet traffic is non-Markovian, and past states do influence routing performance. Moreover, common deep RL approaches use function approximators, such as neural networks, that do not model the spatial structure in network topologies. To address these shortcomings, we design a network environment with non-Markovian traffic and introduce a spatial-temporal RL (STRL) framework for packet routing. Our approach outperforms traditional baselines by more than 19% during training and 7% for inference despite a change in network topology.</p></details> |  |
| **[Other Vehicle Trajectories Are Also Needed: A Driving World Model Unifies Ego-Other Vehicle Trajectories in Video Latent Space](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09215v3)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advanced end-to-end autonomous driving systems predict other vehicles' motions and plan ego vehicle's trajectory. The world model that can foresee the outcome of the trajectory has been used to evaluate the autonomous driving system. However, existing world models predominantly emphasize the trajectory of the ego vehicle and leave other vehicles uncontrollable. This limitation hinders their ability to realistically simulate the interaction between the ego vehicle and the driving scenario. In this paper, we propose a driving World Model named EOT-WM, unifying Ego-Other vehicle Trajectories in videos for driving simulation. Specifically, it remains a challenge to match multiple trajectories in the BEV space with each vehicle in the video to control the video generation. We first project ego-other vehicle trajectories in the BEV space into the image coordinate for vehicle-trajectory match via pixel positions. Then, trajectory videos are encoded by the Spatial-Temporal Variational Auto Encoder to align with driving video latents spatially and temporally in the unified visual space. A trajectory-injected diffusion Transformer is further designed to denoise the noisy video latents for video generation with the guidance of ego-other vehicle trajectories. In addition, we propose a metric based on control latent similarity to evaluate the controllability of trajectories. Extensive experiments are conducted on the nuScenes dataset, and the proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art method by 30% in FID and 55% in FVD. The model can also predict unseen driving scenes with self-produced trajectories.</p></details> | 8 pages, 7 figures |

Motor imagery (MI) decoding has received significant attention due to its intuitive mechanism. However, most existing models rely on single-stream architectures and overlook the multi-view nature of EEG signals, leading to limited performance and generalization. We propose a multi-view contrastive network (MVCNet), a dual-branch architecture that parallelly integrates CNN and Transformer blocks to capture both local spatial-temporal features and global temporal dependencies. To enhance the informativeness of training data, MVCNet incorporates a unified augmentation pipeline across time, frequency, and spatial domains. Two contrastive modules are further introduced: a cross-view contrastive module that enforces consistency of original and augmented views, and a cross-model contrastive module that aligns features extracted from both branches. Final representations are fused and jointly optimized by contrastive and classification losses. Experiments on five public MI datasets across three scenarios demonstrate that MVCNet consistently outperforms nine state-of-the-art MI decoding networks, highlighting its effectiveness and generalization ability. MVCNet provides a robust solution for MI decoding by integrating multi-view information and dual-branch modeling, contributing to the development of more reliable BCI systems.</p></details> | 12 pages, 9 figures |

Foundation Models (FMs) can help improve forecasting of renewable generation and demand because FMs can rapidly process complex, high-dimensional time-series data. This review paper focuses on FMs in the realm of renewable energy forecasting, primarily focusing on wind and solar. We present an overview of the architectures, pretraining strategies, finetuning methods, and types of data used in the context of renewable energy forecasting. We emphasize the role of models that are trained at a large scale, domain specific Transformer architectures, where attention is paid to spatial temporal correlations, the embedding of domain knowledge, and also the brief and intermittent nature of renewable generation. We assess recent FM based advancements in forecast accuracy such as reconciling predictions over multiple time scales and quantifying uncertainty in renewable energy forecasting. We also review existing challenges and areas of improvement in long-term and multivariate time series forecasting. In this survey, a distinction between theory and practice is established regarding the use of FMs in the clean energy forecasting domain. Additionally, it critically assesses the strengths and weaknesses of FMs while advancing future research direction in this new and exciting area of forecasting.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is currently under review at the journal</p></details> |

Existing approaches often struggle to balance accuracy and speed, particularly in resource-constrained environments. In this work, we present a unified framework that leverages advanced spatial-temporal modeling techniques for simultaneous action recognition and object tracking. Our approach builds upon recent advances in parallel sequence modeling and introduces a novel hierarchical attention mechanism that adaptively focuses on relevant spatial regions across temporal sequences. We demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks while maintaining real-time inference speeds. Extensive experiments on UCF-101, HMDB-51, and MOT17 datasets show improvements of 3.2% in action recognition accuracy and 2.8% in tracking precision compared to existing methods, with 40% faster inference time.</p></details> |  |

While functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) offers a non-invasive approach to capture brain-wide neural dynamics with high spatial precision, decoding from fMRI data -- particularly from task-evoked activity -- remains challenging due to its high dimensionality, low signal-to-noise ratio, and limited within-subject data. Here, we leverage recent advances in computer vision and propose STDA-SwiFT, a transformer-based model that learns transferable representations from large-scale fMRI datasets via spatial-temporal divided attention and self-supervised contrastive learning. Using pretrained voxel-wise representations from 995 subjects in the Human Connectome Project (HCP), we show that our model substantially improves downstream decoding performance of task-evoked activity across multiple sensory and cognitive domains, even with minimal data preprocessing. We demonstrate performance gains from larger receptor fields afforded by our memory-efficient attention mechanism, as well as the impact of functional relevance in pretraining data when fine-tuning on small samples. Our work showcases transfer learning as a viable approach to harness large-scale datasets to overcome challenges in decoding brain activity from fMRI data.</p></details> |  |

However, it requires synchronizing multiple dancers while maintaining spatial coordination. As the number of dancers and sequence length increase, this task faces higher computational complexity and a greater risk of motion collisions. Existing methods often struggle to model dense spatial-temporal interactions, leading to scalability issues and multi-dancer collisions. To address these challenges, we propose ST-GDance, a novel framework that decouples spatial and temporal dependencies to optimize long-term and collision-free group choreography. We employ lightweight graph convolutions for distance-aware spatial modeling and accelerated sparse attention for efficient temporal modeling. This design significantly reduces computational costs while ensuring smooth and collision-free interactions. Experiments on the AIOZ-GDance dataset demonstrate that ST-GDance outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, particularly in generating long and coherent group dance sequences.

Apart from motion semantics preservation, ensuring geometric plausibility and maintaining temporal consistency are also crucial for effective motion retargeting. However, many existing methods prioritize either geometric plausibility or temporal consistency. Neglecting geometric plausibility results in interpenetration while neglecting temporal consistency leads to motion jitter. In this paper, we propose a novel sequence-to-sequence model for seamless Spatial-Temporal aware motion Retargeting (STaR), with penetration and consistency constraints. STaR consists of two modules: (1) a spatial module that incorporates dense shape representation and a novel limb penetration constraint to ensure geometric plausibility while preserving motion semantics, and (2) a temporal module that utilizes a temporal transformer and a novel temporal consistency constraint to predict the entire motion sequence at once while enforcing multi-level trajectory smoothness. The seamless combination of the two modules helps us achieve a good balance between the semantic, geometric, and temporal targets. Extensive experiments on the Mixamo and ScanRet datasets demonstrate that our method produces plausible and coherent motions while significantly reducing interpenetration rates compared with other approaches.

This allocation relies on simulations to experiment with various scenarios. The main objective of this allocation is the global optimization of the firefighters response. Data generation is then mandatory to study various scenarios In this study, we propose to compare different data generation methods. Methods such as Random Sampling, Tabular Variational Autoencoders, standard Generative Adversarial Networks, Conditional Tabular Generative Adversarial Networks and Diffusion Probabilistic Models are examined to ascertain their efficacy in capturing the intricacies of firefighter interventions. Traditional evaluation metrics often fall short in capturing the nuanced requirements of synthetic datasets for real-world scenarios. To address this gap, an evaluation of synthetic data quality is conducted using a combination of domain-specific metrics tailored to the firefighting domain and standard measures such as the Wasserstein distance. Domain-specific metrics include response time distribution, spatial-temporal distribution of interventions, and accidents representation. These metrics are designed to assess data variability, the preservation of fine and complex correlations and anomalies such as event with a very low occurrence, the conformity with the initial statistical distribution and the operational relevance of the synthetic data.

In this paper, we propose a novel stagewise trading framework to achieve efficient and stable task-worker matching, explicitly accounting for task diversity (e.g., spatio-temporal limitations) and network dynamics inherent in MCS environments. This framework integrates both futures and spot trading stages. In the former, we introduce the \textbf{f}utures \textbf{t}rading-driven \textbf{s}table \textbf{m}atching and \textbf{p}re-\textbf{p}ath-\textbf{p}lanning mechanism (FT-SMP$^3$), which enables long-term task-worker assignment and pre-planning of workers' trajectories based on historical statistics and risk-aware analysis.

Our evaluation across well-known spatial-temporal action localization datasets, namely UCF101-24 , J-HMDB-21 and AVA shows that the proposed module considerably enhances the model's performance in limited labeled data settings. Our framework achieves superior results compared to extended image-based semi-supervised baselines.</p></details> |  |

However, existing approaches often struggle to effectively model the intricate interdependencies among spatial, temporal, and contextual variables that govern accident outcomes. In this study, we introduce STARN-GAT, a Multi-Modal Spatio-Temporal Graph Attention Network, which leverages adaptive graph construction and modality-aware attention mechanisms to capture these complex relationships. Unlike conventional methods, STARN-GAT integrates road network topology, temporal traffic patterns, and environmental context within a unified attention-based framework. The model is evaluated on the Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) dataset, achieving a Macro F1-score of 85 percent, ROC-AUC of 0.91, and recall of 81 percent for severe incidents. To ensure generalizability within the South Asian context, STARN-GAT is further validated on the ARI-BUET traffic accident dataset, where it attains a Macro F1-score of 0.84, recall of 0.78, and ROC-AUC of 0.89. These results demonstrate the model's effectiveness in identifying high-risk cases and its potential for deployment in real-time, safety-critical traffic management systems. Furthermore, the attention-based architecture enhances interpretability, offering insights into contributing factors and supporting trust in AI-assisted decision-making.

Recent advances highlight the potential of temporal modeling in addressing challenges like occlusions and extended perception range. However, existing methods either fail to fully exploit temporal information or incur substantial computational overhead in handling extended sequences. To tackle these challenges, we propose MambaMap, a novel framework that efficiently fuses long-range temporal features in the state space to construct online vectorized HD maps. Specifically, MambaMap incorporates a memory bank to store and utilize information from historical frames, dynamically updating BEV features and instance queries to improve robustness against noise and occlusions. Moreover, we introduce a gating mechanism in the state space, selectively integrating dependencies of map elements in high computational efficiency. In addition, we design innovative multi-directional and spatial-temporal scanning strategies to enhance feature extraction at both BEV and instance levels. These strategies significantly boost the prediction accuracy of our approach while ensuring robust temporal consistency. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes and Argoverse2 datasets demonstrate that our proposed MambaMap approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods across various splits and perception ranges.

However, its inherent lack of spatial precision introduces challenges for robotic task definition such as ambiguity and verbosity. Moreover, in some public settings where quiet is required, such as libraries or hospitals, verbal communication with robots is inappropriate. To address these limitations, we introduce the Robotic Visual Instruction (RoVI), a novel paradigm to guide robotic tasks through an object-centric, hand-drawn symbolic representation. RoVI effectively encodes spatial-temporal information into human-interpretable visual instructions through 2D sketches, utilizing arrows, circles, colors, and numbers to direct 3D robotic manipulation. To enable robots to understand RoVI better and generate precise actions based on RoVI, we present Visual Instruction Embodied Workflow (VIEW), a pipeline formulated for RoVI-conditioned policies. This approach leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to interpret RoVI inputs, decode spatial and temporal constraints from 2D pixel space via keypoint extraction, and then transform them into executable 3D action sequences. We additionally curate a specialized dataset of 15K instances to fine-tune small VLMs for edge deployment,enabling them to effectively learn RoVI capabilities. Our approach is rigorously validated across 11 novel tasks in both real and simulated environments, demonstrating significant generalization capability. Notably, VIEW achieves an 87.5% success rate in real-world scenarios involving unseen tasks that feature multi-step actions, with disturbances, and trajectory-following requirements.

However, predicting these co-visitation patterns across millions of venues remains challenging due to extreme data sparsity and the complex interplay between spatial proximity and business relationships. Traditional approaches using only geographic distance fail to capture why coffee shops attract different customer flows than fine dining restaurants, even when co-located. We introduce NAICS-aware GraphSAGE, a novel graph neural network that integrates business taxonomy knowledge through learnable embeddings to predict population-scale co-visitation patterns. Our key insight is that business semantics, captured through detailed industry codes, provide crucial signals that pure spatial models cannot explain. The approach scales to massive datasets (4.2 billion potential venue pairs) through efficient state-wise decomposition while combining spatial, temporal, and socioeconomic features in an end-to-end framework. Evaluated on our POI-Graph dataset comprising 94.9 million co-visitation records across 92,486 brands and 48 US states, our method achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art baselines: the R-squared value increases from 0.243 to 0.625 (a 157 percent improvement), with strong gains in ranking quality (32 percent improvement in NDCG at 10).</p></details> |  |
| **[Object-centric Video Question Answering with Visual Grounding and Referring](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19599v1)** | 2025-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable progress in general video understanding. However, existing models primarily focus on high-level comprehension and are limited to text-only responses, restricting the flexibility for object-centric, multiround interactions. In this paper, we make three contributions: (i) we address these limitations by introducing a VideoLLM model, capable of performing both object referring for input and grounding for output in video reasoning tasks, i.e., allowing users to interact with videos using both textual and visual prompts; (ii) we propose STOM (Spatial-Temporal Overlay Module), a novel approach that propagates arbitrary visual prompts input at any single timestamp to the remaining frames within a video; (iii) we present VideoInfer, a manually curated object-centric video instruction dataset featuring questionanswering pairs that require reasoning. We conduct comprehensive experiments on VideoInfer and other existing benchmarks across video question answering and referring object segmentation. The results on 12 benchmarks of 6 tasks show that our proposed model consistently outperforms baselines in both video question answering and segmentation, underscoring its robustness in multimodal, object-centric video and image understanding.

| **[Cross Spatial Temporal Fusion Attention for Remote Sensing Object Detection via Image Feature Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19118v1)** | 2025-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effectively describing features for cross-modal remote sensing image matching remains a challenging task due to the significant geometric and radiometric differences between multimodal images. Existing methods primarily extract features at the fully connected layer but often fail to capture cross-modal similarities effectively. We propose a Cross Spatial Temporal Fusion (CSTF) mechanism that enhances feature representation by integrating scale-invariant keypoints detected independently in both reference and query images. Our approach improves feature matching in two ways: First, by creating correspondence maps that leverage information from multiple image regions simultaneously, and second, by reformulating the similarity matching process as a classification task using SoftMax and Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) layers. This dual approach enables CSTF to maintain sensitivity to distinctive local features while incorporating broader contextual information, resulting in robust matching across diverse remote sensing modalities. To demonstrate the practical utility of improved feature matching, we evaluate CSTF on object detection tasks using the HRSC2016 and DOTA benchmark datasets. Our method achieves state-of-theart performance with an average mAP of 90.99% on HRSC2016 and 90.86% on DOTA, outperforming existing models. The CSTF model maintains computational efficiency with an inference speed of 12.5 FPS. These results validate that our approach to crossmodal feature matching directly enhances downstream remote sensing applications such as object detection.</p></details> |  |

Although DiT with 3D VAE has become a standard framework for video generation, it introduces challenges in controllable driving video generation, especially for geometry control, rendering existing control methods ineffective. To address these issues, we propose MagicDrive-V2, a novel approach that integrates the MVDiT block and spatial-temporal conditional encoding to enable multi-view video generation and precise geometric control. Additionally, we introduce an efficient method for obtaining contextual descriptions for videos to support diverse textual control, along with a progressive training strategy using mixed video data to enhance training efficiency and generalizability. Consequently, MagicDrive-V2 enables multi-view driving video synthesis with $3.3\times$ resolution and $4\times$ frame count (compared to current SOTA), rich contextual control, and geometric controls. Extensive experiments demonstrate MagicDrive-V2's ability, unlocking broader applications in autonomous driving.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025 camera-ready version, Project Website: https://flymin.github.io/magicdrive-v2/</p></details> |
| **[FrameFusion: Combining Similarity and Importance for Video Token Reduction on Large Vision Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01986v2)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing demand to process long and high-resolution videos significantly burdens Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) due to the enormous number of visual tokens. Existing token reduction methods primarily prune tokens based on importance metrics, such as cumulative attention scores. However, even important tokens may exhibit high redundancy caused by similarity among adjacent video frames and repetitive visual elements. To address this limitation, we propose FrameFusion, a novel token reduction approach integrating similarity-based merging with importance-based pruning. We conduct a thorough study on token similarity characteristics, revealing three key insights: (1) spatially corresponding visual tokens between adjacent frames have higher cosine similarities compared to other token pairs; (2) high token similarities prominently decrease in deeper model layers; and (3) token similarity rankings are highly consistent across different layers. Guided by these observations, FrameFusion computes token similarities exclusively between corresponding visual tokens from adjacent frames, applies token merging at initial successive layers followed by pruning in deeper layers, and adopts a cascaded merging strategy to further enhance efficiency. We evaluate FrameFusion comprehensively across six diverse LVLMs, ranging from 2B to 72B parameters, using five video benchmarks encompassing video retrieval, question-answering, and spatial-temporal understanding tasks. Experiments show that FrameFusion reduces visual tokens by 70%, achieving 1.6-3.6x end-to-end speedups, with an average performance impact of less than 3%.

| **[Talk2Event: Grounded Understanding of Dynamic Scenes from Event Cameras](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17664v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Event cameras offer microsecond-level latency and robustness to motion blur, making them ideal for understanding dynamic environments. Yet, connecting these asynchronous streams to human language remains an open challenge. We introduce Talk2Event, the first large-scale benchmark for language-driven object grounding in event-based perception. Built from real-world driving data, we provide over 30,000 validated referring expressions, each enriched with four grounding attributes -- appearance, status, relation to viewer, and relation to other objects -- bridging spatial, temporal, and relational reasoning. To fully exploit these cues, we propose EventRefer, an attribute-aware grounding framework that dynamically fuses multi-attribute representations through a Mixture of Event-Attribute Experts (MoEE). Our method adapts to different modalities and scene dynamics, achieving consistent gains over state-of-the-art baselines in event-only, frame-only, and event-frame fusion settings. We hope our dataset and approach will establish a foundation for advancing multimodal, temporally-aware, and language-driven perception in real-world robotics and autonomy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint; 42 pages, 17 figures, 16 tables; Project Page at https://talk2event.github.io</p></details> |
| **[STQE: Spatial-Temporal Quality Enhancement for G-PCC Compressed Dynamic Point Clouds](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17522v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Very few studies have addressed quality enhancement for compressed dynamic point clouds. In particular, the effective exploitation of spatial-temporal correlations between point cloud frames remains largely unexplored. Addressing this gap, we propose a spatial-temporal attribute quality enhancement (STQE) network that exploits both spatial and temporal correlations to improve the visual quality of G-PCC compressed dynamic point clouds. Our contributions include a recoloring-based motion compensation module that remaps reference attribute information to the current frame geometry to achieve precise inter-frame geometric alignment, a channel-aware temporal attention module that dynamically highlights relevant regions across bidirectional reference frames, a Gaussian-guided neighborhood feature aggregation module that efficiently captures spatial dependencies between geometry and color attributes, and a joint loss function based on the Pearson correlation coefficient, designed to alleviate over-smoothing effects typical of point-wise mean squared error optimization. When applied to the latest G-PCC test model, STQE achieved improvements of 0.855 dB, 0.682 dB, and 0.828 dB in delta PSNR, with Bj{\o}ntegaard Delta rate (BD-rate) reductions of -25.2%, -31.6%, and -32.5% for the Luma, Cb, and Cr components, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[VRU-Accident: A Vision-Language Benchmark for Video Question Answering and Dense Captioning for Accident Scene Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09815v2)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring the safety of vulnerable road users (VRUs), such as pedestrians and cyclists, is a critical challenge for autonomous driving systems, as crashes involving VRUs often result in severe or fatal consequences. While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown promise in enhancing scene understanding and decision making in autonomous vehicles, there is currently no standardized benchmark to quantitatively evaluate their reasoning abilities in complex, safety-critical scenarios involving VRUs. To address this gap, we present VRU-Accident, a large-scale vision-language benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs in high-risk traffic scenarios involving VRUs. VRU-Accident comprises 1K real-world dashcam accident videos, annotated with 6K multiple-choice question-answer pairs across six safety-critical categories (with 24K candidate options and 3.4K unique answer choices), as well as 1K dense scene descriptions. Unlike prior works, our benchmark focuses explicitly on VRU-vehicle accidents, providing rich, fine-grained annotations that capture both spatial-temporal dynamics and causal semantics of accidents. To assess the current landscape of MLLMs, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 17 state-of-the-art models on the multiple-choice VQA task and on the dense captioning task. Our findings reveal that while MLLMs perform reasonably well on visually grounded attributes, they face significant challenges in reasoning and describing accident causes, types, and preventability.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 11 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |
| **[Learning Streaming Video Representation via Multitask Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20041v2)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding continuous video streams plays a fundamental role in real-time applications including embodied AI and autonomous driving. Unlike offline video understanding, streaming video understanding requires the ability to process video streams frame by frame, preserve historical information, and make low-latency decisions. To address these challenges, our main contributions are three-fold. (i) We develop a novel streaming video backbone, termed as StreamFormer, by incorporating causal temporal attention into a pre-trained vision transformer. This enables efficient streaming video processing while maintaining image representation capability. (ii) To train StreamFormer, we propose to unify diverse spatial-temporal video understanding tasks within a multitask visual-language alignment framework. Hence, StreamFormer learns global semantics, temporal dynamics, and fine-grained spatial relationships simultaneously. (iii) We conduct extensive experiments on online action detection, online video instance segmentation, and video question answering. StreamFormer achieves competitive results while maintaining efficiency, demonstrating its potential for real-time applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical Report.

| **[METER: Multi-modal Evidence-based Thinking and Explainable Reasoning -- Algorithm and Benchmark](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16206v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid advancement of generative AI, synthetic content across images, videos, and audio has become increasingly realistic, amplifying the risk of misinformation. Existing detection approaches predominantly focus on binary classification while lacking detailed and interpretable explanations of forgeries, which limits their applicability in safety-critical scenarios. Moreover, current methods often treat each modality separately, without a unified benchmark for cross-modal forgery detection and interpretation. To address these challenges, we introduce METER, a unified, multi-modal benchmark for interpretable forgery detection spanning images, videos, audio, and audio-visual content. Our dataset comprises four tracks, each requiring not only real-vs-fake classification but also evidence-chain-based explanations, including spatio-temporal localization, textual rationales, and forgery type tracing. Compared to prior benchmarks, METER offers broader modality coverage and richer interpretability metrics such as spatial/temporal IoU, multi-class tracing, and evidence consistency. We further propose a human-aligned, three-stage Chain-of-Thought (CoT) training strategy combining SFT, DPO, and a novel GRPO stage that integrates a human-aligned evaluator with CoT reasoning. We hope METER will serve as a standardized foundation for advancing generalizable and interpretable forgery detection in the era of generative media.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages,3 figures ICCV format</p></details> |

Prior efforts have been made on accurate prediction of bike traffics, i.e., demand/pick-up and return/drop-off, to achieve system efficiency. However, bike station-level traffic prediction is difficult because of the spatial-temporal complexity of bike sharing systems. Moreover, such level of prediction over entire bike sharing systems is also challenging due to the large number of bike stations. To fill this gap, we propose BikeMAN, a multi-level spatio-temporal attention neural network to predict station-level bike traffic for entire bike sharing systems. The proposed network consists of an encoder and a decoder with an attention mechanism representing the spatial correlation between features of bike stations in the system and another attention mechanism describing the temporal characteristic of bike station traffic. Through experimental study on over 10 millions trips of bike sharing systems (> 700 stations) of New York City, our network showed high accuracy in predicting the bike station traffic of all stations in the city.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, UrbComp 2024</p></details> |
