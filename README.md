| **[DSAT-HD: Dual-Stream Adaptive Transformer with Hybrid Decomposition for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24800v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting is crucial for various applications, such as weather, traffic, electricity, and energy predictions. Currently, common time series forecasting methods are based on Transformers. However, existing approaches primarily model limited time series or fixed scales, making it more challenging to capture diverse features cross different ranges. Additionally, traditional methods like STL for complex seasonality-trend decomposition require pre-specified seasonal periods and typically handle only single, fixed seasonality. We propose the Hybrid Decomposition Dual-Stream Adaptive Transformer (DSAT-HD), which integrates three key innovations to address the limitations of existing methods: 1) A hybrid decomposition mechanism combining EMA and Fourier decomposition with RevIN normalization, dynamically balancing seasonal and trend components through noise Top-k gating; 2) A multi-scale adaptive pathway leveraging a sparse allocator to route features to four parallel Transformer layers, followed by feature merging via a sparse combiner, enhanced by hybrid attention combining local CNNs and global interactions; 3) A dual-stream residual learning framework where CNN and MLP branches separately process seasonal and trend components, coordinated by a balanced loss function minimizing expert collaboration variance. Extensive experiments on nine datasets demonstrate that DSAT-HD outperforms existing methods overall and achieves state-of-the-art performance on some datasets. Notably, it also exhibits stronger generalization capabilities across various transfer scenarios.</p></details> | 10 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Fidel-TS: A High-Fidelity Benchmark for Multimodal Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24789v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The evaluation of time series forecasting models is hindered by a critical lack of high-quality benchmarks, leading to a potential illusion of progress. Existing datasets suffer from issues ranging from pre-training data contamination in the age of LLMs to the causal and description leakage prevalent in early multimodal designs. To address this, we formalize the core principles of high-fidelity benchmarking, focusing on data sourcing integrity, strict causal soundness, and structural clarity. We introduce Fidel-TS, a new large-scale benchmark built from the ground up on these principles by sourcing data from live APIs. Our extensive experiments validate this approach by exposing the critical biases and design limitations of prior benchmarks. Furthermore, we conclusively demonstrate that the causal relevance of textual information is the key factor in unlocking genuine performance gains in multimodal forecasting.</p></details> |  |
| **[Semantic-Enhanced Time-Series Forecasting via Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07697v3)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting plays a significant role in finance, energy, meteorology, and IoT applications. Recent studies have leveraged the generalization capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to adapt to time series forecasting, achieving promising performance. However, existing studies focus on token-level modal alignment, instead of bridging the intrinsic modality gap between linguistic knowledge structures and time series data patterns, greatly limiting the semantic representation. To address this issue, we propose a novel Semantic-Enhanced LLM (SE-LLM) that explores the inherent periodicity and anomalous characteristics of time series to embed into the semantic space to enhance the token embedding. This process enhances the interpretability of tokens for LLMs, thereby activating the potential of LLMs for temporal sequence analysis. Moreover, existing Transformer-based LLMs excel at capturing long-range dependencies but are weak at modeling short-term anomalies in time-series data. Hence, we propose a plugin module embedded within self-attention that models long-term and short-term dependencies to effectively adapt LLMs to time-series analysis. Our approach freezes the LLM and reduces the sequence dimensionality of tokens, greatly reducing computational consumption. Experiments demonstrate the superiority performance of our SE-LLM against the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.</p></details> | 14 pages,9 figures |
| **[U-Cast: Learning Hierarchical Structures for High-Dimensional Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15119v2)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting (TSF) is a central problem in time series analysis. However, as the number of channels in time series datasets scales to the thousands or more, a scenario we define as High-Dimensional Time Series Forecasting (HDTSF), it introduces significant new modeling challenges that are often not the primary focus of traditional TSF research. HDTSF is challenging because the channel correlation often forms complex and hierarchical patterns. Existing TSF models either ignore these interactions or fail to scale as dimensionality grows. To address this issue, we propose U-Cast, a channel-dependent forecasting architecture that learns latent hierarchical channel structures with an innovative query-based attention. To disentangle highly correlated channel representation, U-Cast adds a full-rank regularization during training. We also release Time-HD, the first benchmark of large, diverse, high-dimensional datasets. Our theory shows that exploiting cross-channel information lowers forecasting risk, and experiments on Time-HD demonstrate that U-Cast surpasses strong baselines in both accuracy and efficiency. Together, U-Cast and Time-HD provide a solid basis for future HDTSF research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint; we release our code publicly at https://github.com/UnifiedTSAI/Time-HD-Lib</p></details> |
| **[Weight-Space Linear Recurrent Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01153v2)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce WARP (Weight-space Adaptive Recurrent Prediction), a simple yet powerful model that unifies weight-space learning with linear recurrence to redefine sequence modeling. Unlike conventional recurrent neural networks (RNNs) which collapse temporal dynamics into fixed-dimensional hidden states, WARP explicitly parametrizes its hidden state as the weights and biases of a distinct auxiliary neural network, and uses input differences to drive its recurrence. This brain-inspired formulation enables efficient gradient-free adaptation of the auxiliary network at test-time, in-context learning abilities, and seamless integration of domain-specific physical priors. Empirical validation shows that WARP matches or surpasses state-of-the-art baselines on diverse classification tasks, featuring in the top three in 5 out of 6 real-world challenging datasets. Furthermore, extensive experiments across sequential image completion, multivariate time series forecasting, and dynamical system reconstruction demonstrate its expressiveness and generalisation capabilities. Remarkably, a physics-informed variant of our model outperforms the next best model by more than 10x. Ablation studies confirm the architectural necessity of key components, solidifying weight-space linear RNNs as a transformative paradigm for adaptive machine intelligence.</p></details> | <details><summary>39 pa...</summary><p>39 pages, 20 figures, 16 tables</p></details> |
| **[A Predictive Approach To Enhance Time-Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15217v3)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate time-series forecasting is crucial in various scientific and industrial domains, yet deep learning models often struggle to capture long-term dependencies and adapt to data distribution shifts over time. We introduce Future-Guided Learning, an approach that enhances time-series event forecasting through a dynamic feedback mechanism inspired by predictive coding. Our method involves two models: a detection model that analyzes future data to identify critical events and a forecasting model that predicts these events based on current data. When discrepancies occur between the forecasting and detection models, a more significant update is applied to the forecasting model, effectively minimizing surprise, allowing the forecasting model to dynamically adjust its parameters. We validate our approach on a variety of tasks, demonstrating a 44.8% increase in AUC-ROC for seizure prediction using EEG data, and a 23.4% reduction in MSE for forecasting in nonlinear dynamical systems (outlier excluded).By incorporating a predictive feedback mechanism, Future-Guided Learning advances how deep learning is applied to time-series forecasting.</p></details> |  |
| **[Echo Flow Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24122v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>At the heart of time-series forecasting (TSF) lies a fundamental challenge: how can models efficiently and effectively capture long-range temporal dependencies across ever-growing sequences? While deep learning has brought notable progress, conventional architectures often face a trade-off between computational complexity and their ability to retain accumulative information over extended horizons. Echo State Networks (ESNs), a class of reservoir computing models, have recently regained attention for their exceptional efficiency, offering constant memory usage and per-step training complexity regardless of input length. This makes them particularly attractive for modeling extremely long-term event history in TSF. However, traditional ESNs fall short of state-of-the-art performance due to their limited nonlinear capacity, which constrains both their expressiveness and stability. We introduce Echo Flow Networks (EFNs), a framework composed of a group of extended Echo State Networks (X-ESNs) with MLP readouts, enhanced by our novel Matrix-Gated Composite Random Activation (MCRA), which enables complex, neuron-specific temporal dynamics, significantly expanding the network's representational capacity without compromising computational efficiency. In addition, we propose a dual-stream architecture in which recent input history dynamically selects signature reservoir features from an infinite-horizon memory, leading to improved prediction accuracy and long-term stability. Extensive evaluations on five benchmarks demonstrate that EFNs achieve up to 4x faster training and 3x smaller model size compared to leading methods like PatchTST, reducing forecasting error from 43% to 35%, a 20% relative improvement. One instantiation of our framework, EchoFormer, consistently achieves new state-of-the-art performance across five benchmark datasets: ETTh, ETTm, DMV, Weather, and Air Quality.</p></details> | Under Review |
| **[PriceFM: Foundation Model for Probabilistic Electricity Price Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04875v2)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electricity price forecasting in Europe presents unique challenges due to the continent's increasingly integrated and physically interconnected power market. While recent advances in deep learning and foundation models have led to substantial improvements in general time series forecasting, most existing approaches fail to capture the complex spatial interdependencies and uncertainty inherent in electricity markets. In this paper, we address these limitations by introducing a comprehensive and up-to-date dataset across 24 European countries (38 regions), spanning from 2022-01-01 to 2025-01-01. Building on this groundwork, we propose PriceFM, a spatiotemporal foundation model that integrates graph-based inductive biases to capture spatial interdependencies across interconnected electricity markets. The model is designed for multi-region, multi-timestep, and multi-quantile probabilistic electricity price forecasting. Extensive experiments and ablation studies confirm the model's effectiveness, consistently outperforming competitive baselines and highlighting the importance of spatial context in electricity markets.

| **[IndexNet: Timestamp and Variable-Aware Modeling for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23813v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF) plays a vital role in a wide range of real-world applications, such as weather prediction and traffic flow forecasting. Although recent advances have significantly improved the modeling of temporal dynamics and inter-variable dependencies, most existing methods overlook index-related descriptive information, such as timestamps and variable indices, which carry rich contextual semantics. To unlock the potential of such information and take advantage of the lightweight and powerful periodic capture ability of MLP-based architectures, we propose IndexNet, an MLP-based framework augmented with an Index Embedding (IE) module. The IE module consists of two key components: Timestamp Embedding (TE) and Channel Embedding (CE). Specifically, TE transforms timestamps into embedding vectors and injects them into the input sequence, thereby improving the model's ability to capture long-term complex periodic patterns. In parallel, CE assigns each variable a unique and trainable identity embedding based on its index, allowing the model to explicitly distinguish between heterogeneous variables and avoid homogenized predictions when input sequences seem close. Extensive experiments on 12 diverse real-world datasets demonstrate that IndexNet achieves comparable performance across mainstream baselines, validating the effectiveness of our temporally and variably aware design. Moreover, plug-and-play experiments and visualization analyses further reveal that IndexNet exhibits strong generality and interpretability, two aspects that remain underexplored in current MTSF research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Neural Networks with Diversity-aware Neighbor Selection and Dynamic Multi-scale Fusion for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23671v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, numerous deep models have been proposed to enhance the performance of multivariate time series (MTS) forecasting. Among them, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)-based methods have shown great potential due to their capability to explicitly model inter-variable dependencies. However, these methods often overlook the diversity of information among neighbors, which may lead to redundant information aggregation. In addition, their final prediction typically relies solely on the representation from a single temporal scale. To tackle these issues, we propose a Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with Diversity-aware Neighbor Selection and Dynamic Multi-scale Fusion (DIMIGNN). DIMIGNN introduces a Diversity-aware Neighbor Selection Mechanism (DNSM) to ensure that each variable shares high informational similarity with its neighbors while maintaining diversity among neighbors themselves. Furthermore, a Dynamic Multi-Scale Fusion Module (DMFM) is introduced to dynamically adjust the contributions of prediction results from different temporal scales to the final forecasting result. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that DIMIGNN consistently outperforms prior methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Scale Spatial-Temporal Hypergraph Network with Lead-Lag Structures for Stock Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23668v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting occurs in a range of financial applications providing essential decision-making support to investors, regulatory institutions, and analysts. Unlike multivariate time series from other domains, stock time series exhibit industry correlation. Exploiting this kind of correlation can improve forecasting accuracy. However, existing methods based on hypergraphs can only capture industry correlation relatively superficially. These methods face two key limitations: they do not fully consider inter-industry lead-lag interactions, and they do not model multi-scale information within and among industries. This study proposes the Hermes framework for stock time series forecasting that aims to improve the exploitation of industry correlation by eliminating these limitations. The framework integrates moving aggregation and multi-scale fusion modules in a hypergraph network. Specifically, to more flexibly capture the lead-lag relationships among industries, Hermes proposes a hyperedge-based moving aggregation module. This module incorporates a sliding window and utilizes dynamic temporal aggregation operations to consider lead-lag dependencies among industries. Additionally, to effectively model multi-scale information, Hermes employs cross-scale, edge-to-edge message passing to integrate information from different scales while maintaining the consistency of each scale. Experimental results on multiple real-world stock datasets show that Hermes outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in both efficiency and accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[CC-Time: Cross-Model and Cross-Modality Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12235v3)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the success of pre-trained language models (PLMs) in various application fields beyond natural language processing, language models have raised emerging attention in the field of time series forecasting (TSF) and have shown great prospects. However, current PLM-based TSF methods still fail to achieve satisfactory prediction accuracy matching the strong sequential modeling power of language models. To address this issue, we propose Cross-Model and Cross-Modality Learning with PLMs for time series forecasting (CC-Time). We explore the potential of PLMs for time series forecasting from two aspects: 1) what time series features could be modeled by PLMs, and 2) whether relying solely on PLMs is sufficient for building time series models. In the first aspect, CC-Time incorporates cross-modality learning to model temporal dependency and channel correlations in the language model from both time series sequences and their corresponding text descriptions. In the second aspect, CC-Time further proposes the cross-model fusion block to adaptively integrate knowledge from the PLMs and time series model to form a more comprehensive modeling of time series patterns. Extensive experiments on nine real-world datasets demonstrate that CC-Time achieves state-of-the-art prediction accuracy in both full-data training and few-shot learning situations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Characteristic Root Analysis and Regularization for Linear Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23597v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting remains a critical challenge across numerous domains, yet the effectiveness of complex models often varies unpredictably across datasets. Recent studies highlight the surprising competitiveness of simple linear models, suggesting that their robustness and interpretability warrant deeper theoretical investigation. This paper presents a systematic study of linear models for time series forecasting, with a focus on the role of characteristic roots in temporal dynamics. We begin by analyzing the noise-free setting, where we show that characteristic roots govern long-term behavior and explain how design choices such as instance normalization and channel independence affect model capabilities. We then extend our analysis to the noisy regime, revealing that models tend to produce spurious roots. This leads to the identification of a key data-scaling property: mitigating the influence of noise requires disproportionately large training data, highlighting the need for structural regularization. To address these challenges, we propose two complementary strategies for robust root restructuring. The first uses rank reduction techniques, including Reduced-Rank Regression and Direct Weight Rank Reduction, to recover the low-dimensional latent dynamics. The second, a novel adaptive method called Root Purge, encourages the model to learn a noise-suppressing null space during training. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of both approaches, validating our theoretical insights and achieving state-of-the-art results in several settings. Our findings underscore the potential of integrating classical theories for linear systems with modern learning techniques to build robust, interpretable, and data-efficient forecasting models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Channel, Trend and Periodic-Wise Representation Learning for Multivariate Long-term Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23583v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Downsampling-based methods for time series forecasting have attracted increasing attention due to their superiority in capturing sequence trends. However, this approaches mainly capture dependencies within subsequences but neglect inter-subsequence and inter-channel interactions, which limits forecasting accuracy. To address these limitations, we propose CTPNet, a novel framework that explicitly learns representations from three perspectives: i) inter-channel dependencies, captured by a temporal query-based multi-head attention mechanism; ii) intra-subsequence dependencies, modeled via a Transformer to characterize trend variations; and iii) inter-subsequence dependencies, extracted by reusing the encoder with residual connections to capture global periodic patterns. By jointly integrating these levels, proposed method provides a more holistic representation of temporal dynamics. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Revisiting Multivariate Time Series Forecasting with Missing Values](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23494v1)** | 2025-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Missing values are common in real-world time series, and multivariate time series forecasting with missing values (MTSF-M) has become a crucial area of research for ensuring reliable predictions. To address the challenge of missing data, current approaches have developed an imputation-then-prediction framework that uses imputation modules to fill in missing values, followed by forecasting on the imputed data. However, this framework overlooks a critical issue: there is no ground truth for the missing values, making the imputation process susceptible to errors that can degrade prediction accuracy. In this paper, we conduct a systematic empirical study and reveal that imputation without direct supervision can corrupt the underlying data distribution and actively degrade prediction accuracy. To address this, we propose a paradigm shift that moves away from imputation and directly predicts from the partially observed time series. We introduce Consistency-Regularized Information Bottleneck (CRIB), a novel framework built on the Information Bottleneck principle. CRIB combines a unified-variate attention mechanism with a consistency regularization scheme to learn robust representations that filter out noise introduced by missing values while preserving essential predictive signals. Comprehensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of CRIB, which predicts accurately even under high missing rates. Our code is available in https://github.com/Muyiiiii/CRIB.</p></details> |  |
| **[ASTGI: Adaptive Spatio-Temporal Graph Interactions for Irregular Multivariate Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23313v1)** | 2025-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Irregular multivariate time series (IMTS) are prevalent in critical domains like healthcare and finance, where accurate forecasting is vital for proactive decision-making. However, the asynchronous sampling and irregular intervals inherent to IMTS pose two core challenges for existing methods: (1) how to accurately represent the raw information of irregular time series without introducing data distortion, and (2) how to effectively capture the complex dynamic dependencies between observation points. To address these challenges, we propose the Adaptive Spatio-Temporal Graph Interaction (ASTGI) framework. Specifically, the framework first employs a Spatio-Temporal Point Representation module to encode each discrete observation as a point within a learnable spatio-temporal embedding space. Second, a Neighborhood-Adaptive Graph Construction module adaptively builds a causal graph for each point in the embedding space via nearest neighbor search. Subsequently, a Spatio-Temporal Dynamic Propagation module iteratively updates information on these adaptive causal graphs by generating messages and computing interaction weights based on the relative spatio-temporal positions between points. Finally, a Query Point-based Prediction module generates the final forecast by aggregating neighborhood information for a new query point and performing regression. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that ASTGI outperforms various state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Signals, Concepts, and Laws: Toward Universal, Explainable Time-Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01407v2)** | 2025-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate, explainable and physically credible forecasting remains a persistent challenge for multivariate time-series whose statistical properties vary across domains. We propose DORIC, a Domain-Universal, ODE-Regularized, Interpretable-Concept Transformer for Time-Series Forecasting that generates predictions through five self-supervised, domain-agnostic concepts while enforcing differentiable residuals grounded in first-principles constraints.</p></details> |  |
| **[ProtoTS: Learning Hierarchical Prototypes for Explainable Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23159v1)** | 2025-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While deep learning has achieved impressive performance in time series forecasting, it becomes increasingly crucial to understand its decision-making process for building trust in high-stakes scenarios. Existing interpretable models often provide only local and partial explanations, lacking the capability to reveal how heterogeneous and interacting input variables jointly shape the overall temporal patterns in the forecast curve. We propose ProtoTS, a novel interpretable forecasting framework that achieves both high accuracy and transparent decision-making through modeling prototypical temporal patterns. ProtoTS computes instance-prototype similarity based on a denoised representation that preserves abundant heterogeneous information. The prototypes are organized hierarchically to capture global temporal patterns with coarse prototypes while capturing finer-grained local variations with detailed prototypes, enabling expert steering and multi-level interpretability. Experiments on multiple realistic benchmarks, including a newly released LOF dataset, show that ProtoTS not only exceeds existing methods in forecast accuracy but also delivers expert-steerable interpretations for better model understanding and decision support.</p></details> | Under submission |
| **[TimeExpert: Boosting Long Time Series Forecasting with Temporal Mix of Experts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23145v1)** | 2025-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer-based architectures dominate time series modeling by enabling global attention over all timestamps, yet their rigid 'one-size-fits-all' context aggregation fails to address two critical challenges in real-world data: (1) inherent lag effects, where the relevance of historical timestamps to a query varies dynamically; (2) anomalous segments, which introduce noisy signals that degrade forecasting accuracy. To resolve these problems, we propose the Temporal Mix of Experts (TMOE), a novel attention-level mechanism that reimagines key-value (K-V) pairs as local experts (each specialized in a distinct temporal context) and performs adaptive expert selection for each query via localized filtering of irrelevant timestamps. Complementing this local adaptation, a shared global expert preserves the Transformer's strength in capturing long-range dependencies. We then replace the vanilla attention mechanism in popular time-series Transformer frameworks (i.e., PatchTST and Timer) with TMOE, without extra structural modifications, yielding our specific version TimeExpert and general version TimeExpert-G. Extensive experiments on seven real-world long-term forecasting benchmarks demonstrate that TimeExpert and TimeExpert-G outperform state-of-the-art methods. Code is available at https://github.com/xwmaxwma/TimeExpert.</p></details> | Under Review |
| **[Towards Robust Real-World Multivariate Time Series Forecasting: A Unified Framework for Dependency, Asynchrony, and Missingness](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08660v2)** | 2025-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world time series data are inherently multivariate, often exhibiting complex inter-channel dependencies. Each channel is typically sampled at its own period and is prone to missing values due to various practical and operational constraints. These characteristics pose three fundamental challenges involving channel dependency, sampling asynchrony, and missingness, all of which must be addressed simultaneously to enable robust and reliable forecasting in practical settings. However, existing architectures typically address only parts of these challenges in isolation and still rely on simplifying assumptions, leaving unresolved the combined challenges of asynchronous channel sampling, test-time missing blocks, and intricate inter-channel dependencies. To bridge this gap, we propose ChannelTokenFormer, a Transformer-based forecasting framework with a flexible architecture designed to explicitly capture cross-channel interactions, accommodate channel-wise asynchronous sampling, and effectively handle missing values. Extensive experiments on public benchmark datasets reflecting practical settings, along with one private real-world industrial dataset, demonstrate the superior robustness and accuracy of ChannelTokenFormer under challenging real-world conditions.</p></details> | 31 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Beyond Model Ranking: Predictability-Aligned Evaluation for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23074v1)** | 2025-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the era of increasingly complex AI models for time series forecasting, progress is often measured by marginal improvements on benchmark leaderboards. However, this approach suffers from a fundamental flaw: standard evaluation metrics conflate a model's performance with the data's intrinsic unpredictability. To address this pressing challenge, we introduce a novel, predictability-aligned diagnostic framework grounded in spectral coherence. Our framework makes two primary contributions: the Spectral Coherence Predictability (SCP), a computationally efficient ($O(N\log N)$) and task-aligned score that quantifies the inherent difficulty of a given forecasting instance, and the Linear Utilization Ratio (LUR), a frequency-resolved diagnostic tool that precisely measures how effectively a model exploits the linearly predictable information within the data. We validate our framework's effectiveness and leverage it to reveal two core insights. First, we provide the first systematic evidence of "predictability drift", demonstrating that a task's forecasting difficulty varies sharply over time. Second, our evaluation reveals a key architectural trade-off: complex models are superior for low-predictability data, whereas linear models are highly effective on more predictable tasks. We advocate for a paradigm shift, moving beyond simplistic aggregate scores toward a more insightful, predictability-aware evaluation that fosters fairer model comparisons and a deeper understanding of model behavior.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pre-training Epidemic Time Series Forecasters with Compartmental Prototypes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03393v4)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate epidemic forecasting is crucial for outbreak preparedness, but existing data-driven models are often brittle. Typically trained on a single pathogen, they struggle with data scarcity during new outbreaks and fail under distribution shifts caused by viral evolution or interventions. However, decades of surveillance data from diverse diseases offer an untapped source of transferable knowledge. To leverage the collective lessons from history, we propose CAPE, the first open-source pre-trained model for epidemic forecasting. Unlike existing time series foundation models that overlook epidemiological challenges, CAPE models epidemic dynamics as mixtures of latent population states, termed compartmental prototypes. It discovers a flexible dictionary of compartment prototypes directly from surveillance data, enabling each outbreak to be expressed as a time-varying mixture that links observed infections to latent population states. To promote robust generalization, CAPE combines self-supervised pre-training objectives with lightweight epidemic-aware regularizers that align the learned prototypes with epidemiological semantics. On a comprehensive benchmark spanning 17 diseases and 50+ regions, CAPE significantly outperforms strong baselines in zero-shot, few-shot, and full-shot forecasting. This work represents a principled step toward pre-trained epidemic models that are both transferable and epidemiologically grounded.</p></details> | version 2.0 |
| **[Learning Temporal Saliency for Time Series Forecasting with Cross-Scale Attention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22839v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Explainability in time series forecasting is essential for improving model transparency and supporting informed decision-making. In this work, we present CrossScaleNet, an innovative architecture that combines a patch-based cross-attention mechanism with multi-scale processing to achieve both high performance and enhanced temporal explainability. By embedding attention mechanisms into the training process, our model provides intrinsic explainability for temporal saliency, making its decision-making process more transparent. Traditional post-hoc methods for temporal saliency detection are computationally expensive, particularly when compared to feature importance detection. While ablation techniques may suffice for datasets with fewer features, identifying temporal saliency poses greater challenges due to its complexity. We validate CrossScaleNet on synthetic datasets with known saliency ground truth and on established public benchmarks, demonstrating the robustness of our method in identifying temporal saliency. Experiments on real-world datasets for forecasting task show that our approach consistently outperforms most transformer-based models, offering better explainability without sacrificing predictive accuracy. Our evaluations demonstrate superior performance in both temporal saliency detection and forecasting accuracy. Moreover, we highlight that existing models claiming explainability often fail to maintain strong performance on standard benchmarks. CrossScaleNet addresses this gap, offering a balanced approach that captures temporal saliency effectively while delivering state-of-the-art forecasting performance across datasets of varying complexity.</p></details> |  |
| **[Aurora: Towards Universal Generative Multimodal Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22295v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cross-domain generalization is very important in Time Series Forecasting because similar historical information may lead to distinct future trends due to the domain-specific characteristics. Recent works focus on building unimodal time series foundation models and end-to-end multimodal supervised models. Since domain-specific knowledge is often contained in modalities like texts, the former lacks the explicit utilization of them, thus hindering the performance. The latter is tailored for end-to-end scenarios and does not support zero-shot inference for cross-domain scenarios. In this work, we introduce Aurora, a Multimodal Time Series Foundation Model, which supports multimodal inputs and zero-shot inference. Pretrained on Corss-domain Multimodal Time Series Corpus, Aurora can adaptively extract and focus on key domain knowledge contained in corrsponding text or image modalities, thus possessing strong Cross-domain generalization capability. Through tokenization, encoding, and distillation, Aurora can extract multimodal domain knowledge as guidance and then utilizes a Modality-Guided Multi-head Self-Attention to inject them into the modeling of temporal representations. In the decoding phase, the multimodal representations are used to generate the conditions and prototypes of future tokens, contributing to a novel Prototype-Guided Flow Matching for generative probabilistic forecasting. Comprehensive experiments on well-recognized benchmarks, including TimeMMD, TSFM-Bench and ProbTS, demonstrate the consistent state-of-the-art performance of Aurora on both unimodal and multimodal scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[TimeMosaic: Temporal Heterogeneity Guided Time Series Forecasting via Adaptive Granularity Patch and Segment-wise Decoding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19406v2)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate time series forecasting is essential in domains such as finance, transportation, climate, and energy. However, existing patch-based methods typically adopt fixed-length segmentation, overlooking the heterogeneity of local temporal dynamics and the decoding heterogeneity of forecasting. Such designs lose details in information-dense regions, introduce redundancy in stable segments, and fail to capture the distinct complexities of short-term and long-term horizons. We propose TimeMosaic, a forecasting framework that aims to address temporal heterogeneity. TimeMosaic employs adaptive patch embedding to dynamically adjust granularity according to local information density, balancing motif reuse with structural clarity while preserving temporal continuity. In addition, it introduces segment-wise decoding that treats each prediction horizon as a related subtask and adapts to horizon-specific difficulty and information requirements, rather than applying a single uniform decoder. Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate that TimeMosaic delivers consistent improvements over existing methods, and our model trained on the large-scale corpus with 321 billion observations achieves performance competitive with state-of-the-art TSFMs.</p></details> |  |

| **[Path Diffuser: Diffusion Model for Data-Driven Traffic Simulator](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24995v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simulating diverse and realistic traffic scenarios is critical for developing and testing autonomous planning. Traditional rule-based planners lack diversity and realism, while learning-based simulators often replay, forecast, or edit scenarios using historical agent trajectories. However, they struggle to generate new scenarios, limiting scalability and diversity due to their reliance on fully annotated logs and historical data. Thus, a key challenge for a learning-based simulator's performance is that it requires agents' past trajectories and pose information in addition to map data, which might not be available for all agents on the road.Without which, generated scenarios often produce unrealistic trajectories that deviate from drivable areas, particularly under out-of-distribution (OOD) map scenes (e.g., curved roads). To address this, we propose Path Diffuser (PD): a two-stage, diffusion model for generating agent pose initializations and their corresponding trajectories conditioned on the map, free of any historical context of agents' trajectories. Furthermore, PD incorporates a motion primitive-based prior, leveraging Frenet frame candidate trajectories to enhance diversity while ensuring road-compliant trajectory generation. We also explore various design choices for modeling complex multi-agent interactions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through extensive experiments on the Argoverse2 Dataset and additionally evaluate the generalizability of the approach on OOD map variants. Notably, Path Diffuser outperforms the baseline methods by 1.92x on distribution metrics, 1.14x on common-sense metrics, and 1.62x on road compliance from adversarial benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can Human Drivers and Connected Autonomous Vehicles Co-exist in Lane-Free Traffic? A Microscopic Simulation Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01189v2)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in connected autonomous vehicle (CAV) technology have sparked growing research interest in lane-free traffic (LFT). LFT envisions a scenario where all vehicles are CAVs, coordinating their movements without lanes to achieve smoother traffic flow and higher road capacity. This potentially reduces congestion without building new infrastructure. However, the transition phase will likely involve non-connected actors such as human-driven vehicles (HDVs) or independent AVs sharing the roads. This raises the question of how LFT performance is impacted when not all vehicles are CAVs, as these non-connected vehicles may prioritize their own benefits over system-wide improvements. This paper addresses this question through microscopic simulation on a ring road, where CAVs follow the potential lines (PL) controller for LFT, while HDVs adhere to a strip-based car-following model. The PL controller is also modified for safe velocities to prevent collisions. The results reveal that even a small percentage of HDVs can significantly disrupt LFT flow: 5% HDVs can reduce LFT's maximum road capacity by 20% and a 40% HDVs nearly halves it, up until 100% HDVs where it drops by nearly 60%. The study also develops an adaptive potential line (APL) controller that forms APL corridors in the surroundings of HDVs. APL shows a peak traffic flow improvement of nearly 10% over the PL controller. The study indicates that a penetration rate of approximately 60% CAVs is required to start observing the major LFT benefits. These findings open a new research direction on minimizing the adverse effects of non-connected vehicles on LFT.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This version corresponds to the final published article in Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies.

| **[Assessing Roundabout Safety Perceptions under Heterogeneous Traffic: Socio-Demographic and Geometric Influences in Indian Urban Contexts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24397v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Evaluation of the safety perceptions of roundabout users is crucial for improving road safety in mixed-traffic environments. The crash- and conflict-based analyses do not incorporate the socio-demographic characteristics of the roundabout users, which can only be captured through questionnaire surveys on a larger scale. This research evaluated the relationship of roundabout safety perception with demographic factors, driving characteristics, and varying roundabout geometries using multiple correspondence analysis, cluster analysis, factor analysis, and multinomial logistic regression. The study analyzed data from 1,530 respondents across two Indian cities. The study identified three roundabout user clusters. Single-lane roundabouts were perceived as safer during entry and circulation, with a significant prominence among middle-aged users. In contrast, double- and multi-lane roundabouts presented higher perceived risks during exit maneuvers, especially among young, inexperienced, unemployed/self-employed users. Vulnerable road users reported significantly higher perceived risks, especially under suboptimal lighting conditions. Respondents with 10-20 years of driving experience, especially car users, perceived lower risk at single-lane roundabouts but acknowledged the higher risk linked to speed variations and complex maneuvers at multi-lane roundabouts. Driving experience, vehicle type, and geometric configurations were crucial in roundabout safety perception. The study highlighted the need to improve the built environment of roundabouts for vulnerable road users. The roundabout merging area was perceived as the most dangerous spot; however, exits were also perceived as dangerous for double- and multi-lane roundabouts. The findings can benefit policymakers, engineers, and urban planners by enabling them to deploy targeted safety interventions based on issues highlighted in the study.</p></details> |  |
| **[Advancing Multi-agent Traffic Simulation via R1-Style Reinforcement Fine-Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23993v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scalable and realistic simulation of multi-agent traffic behavior is critical for advancing autonomous driving technologies. Although existing data-driven simulators have made significant strides in this domain, they predominantly rely on supervised learning to align simulated distributions with real-world driving scenarios. A persistent challenge, however, lies in the distributional shift that arises between training and testing, which often undermines model generalization in unseen environments. To address this limitation, we propose SMART-R1, a novel R1-style reinforcement fine-tuning paradigm tailored for next-token prediction models to better align agent behavior with human preferences and evaluation metrics. Our approach introduces a metric-oriented policy optimization algorithm to improve distribution alignment and an iterative "SFT-RFT-SFT" training strategy that alternates between Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) to maximize performance gains. Extensive experiments on the large-scale Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD) validate the effectiveness of this simple yet powerful R1-style training framework in enhancing foundation models. The results on the Waymo Open Sim Agents Challenge (WOSAC) showcase that SMART-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance with an overall realism meta score of 0.7858, ranking first on the leaderboard at the time of submission.</p></details> |  |
| **[VFSI: Validity First Spatial Intelligence for Constraint-Guided Traffic Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23971v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern diffusion models generate realistic traffic simulations but systematically violate physical constraints. In a large-scale evaluation of SceneDiffuser++, a state-of-the-art traffic simulator, we find that 50% of generated trajectories violate basic physical laws - vehicles collide, drive off roads, and spawn inside buildings. This reveals a fundamental limitation: current models treat physical validity as an emergent property rather than an architectural requirement. We propose Validity-First Spatial Intelligence (VFSI), which enforces constraints through energy-based guidance during diffusion sampling, without model retraining. By incorporating collision avoidance and kinematic constraints as energy functions, we guide the denoising process toward physically valid trajectories. Across 200 urban scenarios from the Waymo Open Motion Dataset, VFSI reduces collision rates by 67% (24.6% to 8.1%) and improves overall validity by 87% (50.3% to 94.2%), while simultaneously improving realism metrics (ADE: 1.34m to 1.21m). Our model-agnostic approach demonstrates that explicit constraint enforcement during inference is both necessary and sufficient for physically valid traffic simulation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning to Explain Air Traffic Situation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10764v3)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding how air traffic controllers construct a mental 'picture' of complex air traffic situations is crucial but remains a challenge due to the inherently intricate, high-dimensional interactions between aircraft, pilots, and controllers. Previous work on modeling the strategies of air traffic controllers and their mental image of traffic situations often centers on specific air traffic control tasks or pairwise interactions between aircraft, neglecting to capture the comprehensive dynamics of an air traffic situation. To address this issue, we propose a machine learning-based framework for explaining air traffic situations. Specifically, we employ a Transformer-based multi-agent trajectory model that encapsulates both the spatio-temporal movement of aircraft and social interaction between them. By deriving attention scores from the model, we can quantify the influence of individual aircraft on overall traffic dynamics. This provides explainable insights into how air traffic controllers perceive and understand the traffic situation. Trained on real-world air traffic surveillance data collected from the terminal airspace around Incheon International Airport in South Korea, our framework effectively explicates air traffic situations. This could potentially support and enhance the decision-making and situational awareness of air traffic controllers.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 3 figures, minor revisions to address reviewer feedback for final submission to the First US-Europe Air Transportation Research and Development (ATRD) Symposium</p></details> |
| **[Security and Privacy Measurement on Chinese Consumer IoT Traffic based on Device Lifecycle](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09929v5)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, consumer Internet of Things (IoT) devices have become widely used in daily life. With the popularity of devices, related security and privacy risks arise at the same time as they collect user-related data and transmit it to various service providers. Although China accounts for a larger share of the consumer IoT industry, current analyses on consumer IoT device traffic primarily focus on regions such as Europe, the United States, and Australia. Research on China, however, is currently relatively rare. This study constructs the first large-scale dataset about consumer IoT device traffic in China. Specifically, we propose a fine-grained traffic collection guidance covering the entire lifecycle of consumer IoT devices, gathering traffic from 77 devices spanning 38 brands and 12 device categories. Based on this dataset, we analyze traffic destinations and encryption practices across different device types during the entire lifecycle and compare the findings with the results of other regions. Compared to other regions, our results show that consumer IoT devices in China rely more on domestic services and overall perform better in terms of encryption practices. However, there are still 23/40 devices improperly conducting certificate validation, and 2/70 devices use insecure encryption protocols. To facilitate future research, we open-source our traffic collection guidance and make our dataset publicly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper was accepted by "Science China Information Sciences" on September 18, 2025.

| **[FuzzyLight: A Robust Two-Stage Fuzzy Approach for Traffic Signal Control Works in Real Cities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15820v2)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effective traffic signal control (TSC) is crucial in mitigating urban congestion and reducing emissions. Recently, reinforcement learning (RL) has been the research trend for TSC. However, existing RL algorithms face several real-world challenges that hinder their practical deployment in TSC: (1) Sensor accuracy deteriorates with increased sensor detection range, and data transmission is prone to noise, potentially resulting in unsafe TSC decisions. (2) During the training of online RL, interactions with the environment could be unstable, potentially leading to inappropriate traffic signal phase (TSP) selection and traffic congestion. (3) Most current TSC algorithms focus only on TSP decisions, overlooking the critical aspect of phase duration, affecting safety and efficiency. To overcome these challenges, we propose a robust two-stage fuzzy approach called FuzzyLight, which integrates compressed sensing and RL for TSC deployment. FuzzyLight offers several key contributions: (1) It employs fuzzy logic and compressed sensing to address sensor noise and enhances the efficiency of TSP decisions. (2) It maintains stable performance during training and combines fuzzy logic with RL to generate precise phases. (3) It works in real cities across 22 intersections and demonstrates superior performance in both real-world and simulated environments. Experimental results indicate that FuzzyLight enhances traffic efficiency by 48% compared to expert-designed timings in the real world. Furthermore, it achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in simulated environments using six real-world datasets with transmission noise.

| **[Network Traffic Classification Using Self-Supervised Learning and Confident Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23522v1)** | 2025-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Network traffic classification (NTC) is vital for efficient network management, security, and performance optimization, particularly with 5G/6G technologies. Traditional methods, such as deep packet inspection (DPI) and port-based identification, struggle with the rise of encrypted traffic and dynamic port allocations. Supervised learning methods provide viable alternatives but rely on large labeled datasets, which are difficult to acquire given the diversity and volume of network traffic. Meanwhile, unsupervised learning methods, while less reliant on labeled data, often exhibit lower accuracy. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework that first leverages Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) with techniques such as autoencoders or Tabular Contrastive Learning (TabCL) to generate pseudo-labels from extensive unlabeled datasets, addressing the challenge of limited labeled data. We then apply traffic-adopted Confident Learning (CL) to refine these pseudo-labels, enhancing classification precision by mitigating the impact of noise. Our proposed framework offers a generalizable solution that minimizes the need for extensive labeled data while delivering high accuracy. Extensive simulations and evaluations, conducted using three datasets (ISCX VPN-nonVPN, self-generated dataset, and UCDavis--QUIC), and demonstrate that our method achieves superior accuracy compared to state-of-the-art techniques in classifying network traffic.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Hybrid TDMA/CSMA Protocol for Time-Sensitive Traffic in Robot Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06119v2)** | 2025-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent progress in robotics has underscored the demand for real-time control in applications such as manufacturing, healthcare, and autonomous systems, where the timely delivery of mission-critical commands under heterogeneous robotic traffic is paramount for operational efficacy and safety. In these scenarios, mission-critical traffic follows a strict deadline-constrained communication pattern: commands must arrive within defined QoS deadlines, otherwise late arrivals can degrade performance or destabilize control loops.In this work, we demonstrate on a real-time SDR platform that CSMA, widely adopted in robotic communications,suffers severe degradation under high robot traffic loads, with contention-induced collisions and delays disrupting the on-time arrival of mission-critical packets. To address this problem, we propose an IEEE 802.11-compatible hybrid TDMA/CSMA protocol that combines TDMA's deterministic slot scheduling with CSMA's adaptability for heterogeneous robot traffic.The protocol achieves collision-free, low-latency mission-critical command delivery and IEEE 802.11 compatibility through the synergistic integration of sub-microsecond PTP-based slot synchronization-essential for establishing precise timing for TDMA, a three-session superframe with dynamic TDMA allocation for structured and adaptable traffic management,and beacon-NAV protection to preemptively secure these critical communication sessions from interference. Emulation experiments on real-time SDR testbed and Robot Operating System (ROS) simulation show that the proposed protocol reduces missed-deadline errors by 93% compared to the CSMA baseline. In high-speed robot path-tracking ROS simulations, the protocol lowers Root Mean Square (RMS) trajectory error by up to 90% compared with a CSMA baseline, all while maintaining throughput for non-critical traffic within +-2%.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Intention-driven Lane Change Framework Considering Heterogeneous Dynamic Cooperation in Mixed-traffic Environment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22550v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In mixed-traffic environments, where autonomous vehicles (AVs) interact with diverse human-driven vehicles (HVs), unpredictable intentions and heterogeneous behaviors make safe and efficient lane change maneuvers highly challenging. Existing methods often oversimplify these interactions by assuming uniform patterns. We propose an intention-driven lane change framework that integrates driving-style recognition, cooperation-aware decision-making, and coordinated motion planning. A deep learning classifier trained on the NGSIM dataset identifies human driving styles in real time. A cooperation score with intrinsic and interactive components estimates surrounding drivers' intentions and quantifies their willingness to cooperate with the ego vehicle. Decision-making combines behavior cloning with inverse reinforcement learning to determine whether a lane change should be initiated. For trajectory generation, model predictive control is integrated with IRL-based intention inference to produce collision-free and socially compliant maneuvers. Experiments show that the proposed model achieves 94.2\% accuracy and 94.3\% F1-score, outperforming rule-based and learning-based baselines by 4-15\% in lane change recognition. These results highlight the benefit of modeling inter-driver heterogeneity and demonstrate the potential of the framework to advance context-aware and human-like autonomous driving in complex traffic environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Impact of Collective Behaviors of Autonomous Vehicles on Urban Traffic Dynamics: A Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22216v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study examines the potential impact of reinforcement learning (RL)-enabled autonomous vehicles (AV) on urban traffic flow in a mixed traffic environment. We focus on a simplified day-to-day route choice problem in a multi-agent setting. We consider a city network where human drivers travel through their chosen routes to reach their destinations in minimum travel time. Then, we convert one-third of the population into AVs, which are RL agents employing Deep Q-learning algorithm. We define a set of optimization targets, or as we call them behaviors, namely selfish, collaborative, competitive, social, altruistic, and malicious. We impose a selected behavior on AVs through their rewards. We run our simulations using our in-house developed RL framework PARCOUR. Our simulations reveal that AVs optimize their travel times by up to 5\%, with varying impacts on human drivers' travel times depending on the AV behavior. In all cases where AVs adopt a self-serving behavior, they achieve shorter travel times than human drivers. Our findings highlight the complexity differences in learning tasks of each target behavior. We demonstrate that the multi-agent RL setting is applicable for collective routing on traffic networks, though their impact on coexisting parties greatly varies with the behaviors adopted.</p></details> | <details><summary>Work ...</summary><p>Work presented at the European Workshop on Reinforcement Learning (EWRL 2024)</p></details> |
| **[Persistent Autoregressive Mapping with Traffic Rules for Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22756v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Safe autonomous driving requires both accurate HD map construction and persistent awareness of traffic rules, even when their associated signs are no longer visible. However, existing methods either focus solely on geometric elements or treat rules as temporary classifications, failing to capture their persistent effectiveness across extended driving sequences. In this paper, we present PAMR (Persistent Autoregressive Mapping with Traffic Rules), a novel framework that performs autoregressive co-construction of lane vectors and traffic rules from visual observations. Our approach introduces two key mechanisms: Map-Rule Co-Construction for processing driving scenes in temporal segments, and Map-Rule Cache for maintaining rule consistency across these segments. To properly evaluate continuous and consistent map generation, we develop MapDRv2, featuring improved lane geometry annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PAMR achieves superior performance in joint vector-rule mapping tasks, while maintaining persistent rule effectiveness throughout extended driving sequences.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reinforcement Learning Based Traffic Signal Design to Minimize Queue Lengths](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21745v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficient traffic signal control (TSC) is crucial for reducing congestion, travel delays, pollution, and for ensuring road safety. Traditional approaches, such as fixed signal control and actuated control, often struggle to handle dynamic traffic patterns. In this study, we propose a novel adaptive TSC framework that leverages Reinforcement Learning (RL), using the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm, to minimize total queue lengths across all signal phases. The challenge of efficiently representing highly stochastic traffic conditions for an RL controller is addressed through multiple state representations, including an expanded state space, an autoencoder representation, and a K-Planes-inspired representation. The proposed algorithm has been implemented using the Simulation of Urban Mobility (SUMO) traffic simulator and demonstrates superior performance over both traditional methods and other conventional RL-based approaches in reducing queue lengths. The best performing configuration achieves an approximately 29% reduction in average queue lengths compared to the traditional Webster method. Furthermore, comparative evaluation of alternative reward formulations demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed queue-based approach, showcasing the potential for scalable and adaptive urban traffic management.</p></details> |  |
| **[MNT-TNN: Spatiotemporal Traffic Data Imputation via Compact Multimode Nonlinear Transform-based Tensor Nuclear Norm](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22955v2)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Imputation of random or non-random missing data is a long-standing research topic and a crucial application for Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). However, with the advent of modern communication technologies such as Global Satellite Navigation Systems (GNSS), traffic data collection has introduced new challenges in random missing value imputation and increasing demands for spatiotemporal dependency modelings. To address these issues, we propose a novel spatiotemporal traffic imputation method based on a Multimode Nonlinear Transformed Tensor Nuclear Norm (MNT-TNN), which can effectively capture the intrinsic multimode spatiotemporal correlations and low-rankness of the traffic tensor, represented as location $\times$ location $\times$ time. To solve the nonconvex optimization problem, we design a proximal alternating minimization (PAM) algorithm with theoretical convergence guarantees. We also suggest an Augmented Transform-based Tensor Nuclear Norm Families (ATTNNs) framework to enhance the imputation results of TTNN techniques, especially at very high miss rates. Extensive experiments on real datasets demonstrate that our proposed MNT-TNN and ATTNNs can outperform the compared state-of-the-art imputation methods, completing the benchmark of random missing traffic value imputation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Semantic Edge-Cloud Communication for Real-Time Urban Traffic Surveillance with ViT and LLMs over Mobile Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21259v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-time urban traffic surveillance is vital for Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) to ensure road safety, optimize traffic flow, track vehicle trajectories, and prevent collisions in smart cities. Deploying edge cameras across urban environments is a standard practice for monitoring road conditions. However, integrating these with intelligent models requires a robust understanding of dynamic traffic scenarios and a responsive interface for user interaction. Although multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) can interpret traffic images and generate informative responses, their deployment on edge devices is infeasible due to high computational demands. Therefore, LLM inference must occur on the cloud, necessitating visual data transmission from edge to cloud, a process hindered by limited bandwidth, leading to potential delays that compromise real-time performance. To address this challenge, we propose a semantic communication framework that significantly reduces transmission overhead. Our method involves detecting Regions of Interest (RoIs) using YOLOv11, cropping relevant image segments, and converting them into compact embedding vectors using a Vision Transformer (ViT). These embeddings are then transmitted to the cloud, where an image decoder reconstructs the cropped images. The reconstructed images are processed by a multimodal LLM to generate traffic condition descriptions. This approach achieves a 99.9% reduction in data transmission size while maintaining an LLM response accuracy of 89% for reconstructed cropped images, compared to 93% accuracy with original cropped images. Our results demonstrate the efficiency and practicality of ViT and LLM-assisted edge-cloud semantic communication for real-time traffic surveillance.</p></details> | 17 pages, 12 figures |
| **[FlowXpert: Context-Aware Flow Embedding for Enhanced Traffic Detection in IoT Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20861v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the Internet of Things (IoT) environment, continuous interaction among a large number of devices generates complex and dynamic network traffic, which poses significant challenges to rule-based detection approaches. Machine learning (ML)-based traffic detection technology, capable of identifying anomalous patterns and potential threats within this traffic, serves as a critical component in ensuring network security. This study first identifies a significant issue with widely adopted feature extraction tools (e.g., CICMeterFlow): the extensive use of time- and length-related features leads to high sparsity, which adversely affects model convergence. Furthermore, existing traffic detection methods generally lack an embedding mechanism capable of efficiently and comprehensively capturing the semantic characteristics of network traffic. To address these challenges, we propose a novel feature extraction tool that eliminates traditional time and length features in favor of context-aware semantic features related to the source host, thus improving the generalizability of the model. In addition, we design an embedding training framework that integrates the unsupervised DBSCAN clustering algorithm with a contrastive learning strategy to effectively capture fine-grained semantic representations of traffic. Extensive empirical evaluations are conducted on the real-world Mawi data set to validate the proposed method in terms of detection accuracy, robustness, and generalization. Comparative experiments against several state-of-the-art (SOTA) models demonstrate the superior performance of our approach. Furthermore, we confirm its applicability and deployability in real-time scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Approximately Optimal Toll Design for Efficiency and Equity in Arc-Based Traffic Assignment Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20355v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Congestion pricing policies have emerged as promising traffic management tools to alleviate traffic congestion caused by travelers' selfish routing behaviors. The core principle behind deploying tolls is to impose monetary costs on frequently overcrowded routes, to incentivize self-interested travelers to select less easily congested routes. Recent literature has focused on toll design based on arc-based traffic assignment models (TAMs), which characterize commuters as traveling through a traffic network by successively selecting an outgoing arc from every intermediate node along their journey. However, existing tolling mechanisms predicated on arc-based TAMs often target the design of a single congestion-minimizing toll, ignoring crucial fairness considerations, such as the financial impact of high congestion fees on low-income travelers. To address these shortcomings, in this paper, we pose the dual considerations of efficiency and equity in traffic routing as bilevel optimization problems. Since such problems are in general computationally intractable to solve precisely, we construct a linear program approximation by introducing a polytope approximation for the set of all tolls that induce congestion-minimizing traffic flow patterns. Finally, we provide numerical results that validate our theoretical conclusions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can LLMs Forecast Internet Traffic from Social Media?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20123v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Societal events shape the Internet's behavior. The death of a prominent public figure, a software launch, or a major sports match can trigger sudden demand surges that overwhelm peering points and content delivery networks. Although these events fall outside regular traffic patterns, forecasting systems still rely solely on those patterns and therefore miss these critical anomalies. Thus, we argue for socio-technical systems that supplement technical measurements with an active understanding of the underlying drivers, including how events and collective behavior shape digital demands. We propose traffic forecasting using signals from public discourse, such as headlines, forums, and social media, as early demand indicators. To validate our intuition, we present a proof-of-concept system that autonomously scrapes online discussions, infers real-world events, clusters and enriches them semantically, and correlates them with traffic measurements at a major Internet Exchange Point. This prototype predicted between 56-92% of society-driven traffic spikes after scraping a moderate amount of online discussions. We believe this approach opens new research opportunities in cross-domain forecasting, scheduling, demand anticipation, and society-informed decision making.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures |

Urban deployments demand scalable, real-time tracking solutions, yet traditional remote sensing remains costly and computationally intensive, especially under perceptually degraded conditions. Our sensor node couples a single lidar with an edge computing unit and runs a computationally efficient, GPU-free observer that simultaneously estimates object state, class, dimensions, and existence probability. The pipeline performs: (i) state updates via an extended Kalman filter, (ii) dimension estimation using a 1D grid-map/Bayesian update, (iii) class updates via a lookup table driven by the most probable footprint, and (iv) existence estimation from track age and bounding-box consistency. Experiments in dynamic urban-like scenes with diverse traffic participants demonstrate real-time performance and high precision: The complete end-to-end pipeline finishes within \SI{100}{\milli\second} for \SI{99.88}{\%} of messages, with an excellent detection rate. Robustness is further confirmed under simulated wind and sensor vibration. These results indicate that reliable, real-time roadside tracking is feasible on CPU-only edge hardware, enabling scalable, privacy-friendly deployments within existing city infrastructure. The framework integrates with existing poles, traffic lights, and buildings, reducing deployment costs and simplifying large-scale urban rollouts and maintenance efforts.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 9 figures, this work was submitted to Wileys'Advanced Intelligent Systems for review</p></details> |

Infrastructure-based vision sensors offer scalable and efficient solutions for continuous real-time monitoring, facilitating automated detection of accidents directly from captured images. This research investigates the zero-shot capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for detecting and describing traffic accidents using images from infrastructure cameras, thus minimizing reliance on extensive labeled datasets. Main contributions include: (1) Evaluation of MLLMs using the simulated DeepAccident dataset from CARLA, explicitly addressing the scarcity of diverse, realistic, infrastructure-based accident data through controlled simulations; (2) Comparative performance analysis between Gemini 1.5 and 2.0, Gemma 3 and Pixtral models in accident identification and descriptive capabilities without prior fine-tuning; and (3) Integration of advanced visual analytics, specifically YOLO for object detection, Deep SORT for multi-object tracking, and Segment Anything (SAM) for instance segmentation, into enhanced prompts to improve model accuracy and explainability. Key numerical results show Pixtral as the top performer with an F1-score of 0.71 and 83% recall, while Gemini models gained precision with enhanced prompts (e.g., Gemini 1.5 rose to 90%) but suffered notable F1 and recall losses. Gemma 3 offered the most balanced performance with minimal metric fluctuation. These findings demonstrate the substantial potential of integrating MLLMs with advanced visual analytics techniques, enhancing their applicability in real-world automated traffic monitoring systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for presentation at the 2025 IEEE International Automated Vehicle Validation Conference (IAVVC 2025).

Although spatio-temporal traffic prediction has received extensive research attention, further improvements in prediction accuracy and computational efficiency remain necessary. In particular, existing decomposition-based methods or hybrid architectures often incur heavy overhead when capturing local and global feature correlations, necessitating novel approaches that optimize accuracy and complexity. In this paper, we propose an efficient spatio-temporal network traffic prediction framework, DP-LET, which consists of a data processing module, a local feature enhancement module, and a Transformer-based prediction module. The data processing module is designed for high-efficiency denoising of network data and spatial decoupling. In contrast, the local feature enhancement module leverages multiple Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs) to capture fine-grained local features. Meanwhile, the prediction module utilizes a Transformer encoder to model long-term dependencies and assess feature relevance. A case study on real-world cellular traffic prediction demonstrates the practicality of DP-LET, which maintains low computational complexity while achieving state-of-the-art performance, significantly reducing MSE by 31.8% and MAE by 23.1% compared to baseline models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for presentation to the 2025 IEEE Global Communications Conference (IEEE GLOBECOM)</p></details> |
| **[MsFIN: Multi-scale Feature Interaction Network for Traffic Accident Anticipation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19227v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the widespread deployment of dashcams and advancements in computer vision, developing accident prediction models from the dashcam perspective has become critical for proactive safety interventions. However, two key challenges persist: modeling feature-level interactions among traffic participants (often occluded in dashcam views) and capturing complex, asynchronous multi-temporal behavioral cues preceding accidents. To deal with these two challenges, a Multi-scale Feature Interaction Network (MsFIN) is proposed for early-stage accident anticipation from dashcam videos. MsFIN has three layers for multi-scale feature aggregation, temporal feature processing and multi-scale feature post fusion, respectively. For multi-scale feature aggregation, a Multi-scale Module is designed to extract scene representations at short-term, mid-term and long-term temporal scales. Meanwhile, the Transformer architecture is leveraged to facilitate comprehensive feature interactions. Temporal feature processing captures the sequential evolution of scene and object features under causal constraints. In the multi-scale feature post fusion stage, the network fuses scene and object features across multiple temporal scales to generate a comprehensive risk representation. Experiments on DAD and DADA datasets show that MsFIN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models with single-scale feature extraction in both prediction correctness and earliness. Ablation studies validate the effectiveness of each module in MsFIN, highlighting how the network achieves superior performance through multi-scale feature fusion and contextual interaction modeling.</p></details> |  |
| **[Interaction-aware Lane-Changing Early Warning System in Congested Traffic](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18624v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Lane changes (LCs) in congested traffic are complex, multi-vehicle interactive events that pose significant safety concerns. Providing early warnings can enable more proactive driver assistance system and support more informed decision-making for drivers under LCs. This paper presents an interaction-aware Lane-Changing Early Warning (LCEW) system designed to issue reliable early warning signals based on future trajectory predictions. We first investigate the stochastic nature of LCs, characterized by (i) variable-size multi-vehicle interactions and (ii) the direct and indirect risks resulting from these interactions. To model these stochastic interactions, a Social Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Neural Network framework informed by mutual information (STGCNN-MI) is introduced to predict multi-vehicle trajectories. By leveraging a MI-based adjacency matrix, the framework enhances trajectory prediction accuracy while providing interpretable representations of vehicle interactions. Then, potential collisions between the LC vehicle and adjacent vehicles (direct risks) or among the non-adjacent vehicles (indirect risks) are identified using oriented bounding box detection applied to the predicted trajectories. Finally, a warning signal is generated to inform the LC driver of location of potential collisions within the predicted time window. Traffic simulation experiments conducted in SUMO demonstrate that the proposed interaction-aware LCEW improves both vehicle-level safety and overall traffic efficiency, while also promoting more natural behavioral adaptation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Building Transparency in Deep Learning-Powered Network Traffic Classification: A Traffic-Explainer Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18007v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in deep learning have significantly enhanced the performance and efficiency of traffic classification in networking systems. However, the lack of transparency in their predictions and decision-making has made network operators reluctant to deploy DL-based solutions in production networks. To tackle this challenge, we propose Traffic-Explainer, a model-agnostic and input-perturbation-based traffic explanation framework. By maximizing the mutual information between predictions on original traffic sequences and their masked counterparts, Traffic-Explainer automatically uncovers the most influential features driving model predictions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Traffic-Explainer improves upon existing explanation methods by approximately 42%. Practically, we further apply Traffic-Explainer to identify influential features and demonstrate its enhanced transparency across three critical tasks: application classification, traffic localization, and network cartography. For the first two tasks, Traffic-Explainer identifies the most decisive bytes that drive predicted traffic applications and locations, uncovering potential vulnerabilities and privacy concerns. In network cartography, Traffic-Explainer identifies submarine cables that drive the mapping of traceroute to physical path, enabling a traceroute-informed risk analysis.</p></details> |  |

This work explores the feasibility of using physical channel data collected from the air interface of 5G Standalone (SA) networks for traffic sensing. We develop a preprocessing pipeline to transform raw channel records into structured representations with customized feature engineering to enhance downstream classification performance. To jointly capture temporal dependencies and both local and global structural patterns inherent in physical channel records, we propose a novel hybrid architecture: BiLSTM-Conformer Network (BiLCNet), which integrates the sequential modeling capability of Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory networks (BiLSTM) with the spatial feature extraction strength of Conformer blocks. Evaluated on a noise-limited 5G SA dataset, our model achieves a classification accuracy of 93.9%, outperforming a series of conventional machine learning and deep learning algorithms. Furthermore, we demonstrate its generalization ability under zero-shot transfer settings, validating its robustness across traffic categories and varying environmental conditions.</p></details> | 6 pages, 5 figures |

Reproducing the method of Aoki et al., we observe that on dense OD graphs the curl and harmonic components are negligible and the potential closely tracks node divergence, limiting the added value of Hodge potentials. In contrast, on a real road network (UTD19, downtown Los Angeles; 15-minute resolution), potentials differ substantially from divergence and exhibit clear morning/evening reversals consistent with commute patterns. We quantify smoothness and discriminability via local/global variances derived from the graph spectrum, and propose flow-aware embeddings that combine topology, bidirectional volume, and net-flow asymmetry for clustering. Code and preprocessing steps are provided to facilitate reproducibility.</p></details> |  |
| **[FP-Inconsistent: Measurement and Analysis of Fingerprint Inconsistencies in Evasive Bot Traffic](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07647v3)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As browser fingerprinting is increasingly being used for bot detection, bots have started altering their fingerprints for evasion. We conduct the first large-scale evaluation of evasive bots to investigate whether and how altering fingerprints helps bots evade detection. To systematically investigate evasive bots, we deploy a honey site incorporating two anti-bot services (DataDome and BotD) and solicit bot traffic from 20 different bot services that purport to sell "realistic and undetectable traffic". Across half a million requests from 20 different bot services on our honey site, we find an average evasion rate of 52.93% against DataDome and 44.56% evasion rate against BotD. Our comparison of fingerprint attributes from bot services that evade each anti-bot service individually as well as bot services that evade both shows that bot services indeed alter different browser fingerprint attributes for evasion. Further, our analysis reveals the presence of inconsistent fingerprint attributes in evasive bots. Given evasive bots seem to have difficulty in ensuring consistency in their fingerprint attributes, we propose a data-driven approach to discover rules to detect such inconsistencies across space (two attributes in a given browser fingerprint) and time (a single attribute at two different points in time). These rules, which can be readily deployed by anti-bot services, reduce the evasion rate of evasive bots against DataDome and BotD by 48.11% and 44.95% respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[RIFT: Group-Relative RL Fine-Tuning for Realistic and Controllable Traffic Simulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03344v3)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Achieving both realism and controllability in closed-loop traffic simulation remains a key challenge in autonomous driving. Dataset-based methods reproduce realistic trajectories but suffer from covariate shift in closed-loop deployment, compounded by simplified dynamics models that further reduce reliability. Conversely, physics-based simulation methods enhance reliable and controllable closed-loop interactions but often lack expert demonstrations, compromising realism. To address these challenges, we introduce a dual-stage AV-centric simulation framework that conducts imitation learning pre-training in a data-driven simulator to capture trajectory-level realism and route-level controllability, followed by reinforcement learning fine-tuning in a physics-based simulator to enhance style-level controllability and mitigate covariate shift. In the fine-tuning stage, we propose RIFT, a novel group-relative RL fine-tuning strategy that evaluates all candidate modalities through group-relative formulation and employs a surrogate objective for stable optimization, enhancing style-level controllability and mitigating covariate shift while preserving the trajectory-level realism and route-level controllability inherited from IL pre-training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RIFT improves realism and controllability in traffic simulation while simultaneously exposing the limitations of modern AV systems in closed-loop evaluation.

| **[Deformable Dynamic Convolution for Accurate yet Efficient Spatio-Temporal Traffic Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11550v2)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic prediction is a critical component of intelligent transportation systems, enabling applications such as congestion mitigation and accident risk prediction. While recent research has explored both graph-based and grid-based approaches, key limitations remain. Graph-based methods effectively capture non-Euclidean spatial structures but often incur high computational overhead, limiting their practicality in large-scale systems. In contrast, grid-based methods, which primarily leverage Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), offer greater computational efficiency but struggle to model irregular spatial patterns due to the fixed shape of their filters. Moreover, both approaches often fail to account for inherent spatio-temporal heterogeneity, as they typically apply a shared set of parameters across diverse regions and time periods. To address these challenges, we propose the Deformable Dynamic Convolutional Network (DDCN), a novel CNN-based architecture that integrates both deformable and dynamic convolution operations. The deformable layer introduces learnable offsets to create flexible receptive fields that better align with spatial irregularities, while the dynamic layer generates region-specific filters, allowing the model to adapt to varying spatio-temporal traffic patterns. By combining these two components, DDCN effectively captures both non-Euclidean spatial structures and spatio-temporal heterogeneity. Extensive experiments on four real-world traffic datasets demonstrate that DDCN achieves competitive predictive performance while significantly reducing computational costs, underscoring its potential for large-scale and real-time deployment.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures |

A key area has been TSN's time-aware traffic shaping (TAS), which supports stringent end-to-end latency and reliability requirements. Configuration of TAS requires the computation of a network-wide traffic schedule, which is particularly challenging with integrated wireless networks (e.g., 5G, Wi-Fi) due to the stochastic nature of wireless links. This paper introduces a novel method for configuring TAS, focusing on cyclic traffic patterns and jitter of wireless links. We formulate a linear program that computes a network-wide time-aware schedule, robust to wireless performance uncertainties. The given method enables robust scheduling of multiple TSN frames per transmission window using a tunable robustness parameter ({\Gamma}). To reduce computational complexity, we also propose a sequential batch-scheduling heuristic that runs in polynomial time. Our approach is evaluated by using different network topologies and wireless link characteristics, demonstrating that the heuristic can schedule 90% of 6500 requested TSN streams in a large topology.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted for publication in the proceedings of the 21st International Conference on Network and Service Management (CNSM 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Inference Attacks on Encrypted Online Voting via Traffic Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15694v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Online voting enables individuals to participate in elections remotely, offering greater efficiency and accessibility in both governmental and organizational settings. As this method gains popularity, ensuring the security of online voting systems becomes increasingly vital, as the systems supporting it must satisfy a demanding set of security requirements. Most research in this area emphasizes the design and verification of cryptographic protocols to protect voter integrity and system confidentiality. However, other vectors, such as network traffic analysis, remain relatively understudied, even though they may pose significant threats to voter privacy and the overall trustworthiness of the system. In this paper, we examine how adversaries can exploit metadata from encrypted network traffic to uncover sensitive information during online voting. Our analysis reveals that, even without accessing the encrypted content, it is possible to infer critical voter actions, such as whether a person votes, the exact moment a ballot is submitted, and whether the ballot is valid or spoiled. We test these attacks with both rule-based techniques and machine learning methods. We evaluate our attacks on two widely used online voting platforms, one proprietary and one partially open source, achieving classification accuracy as high as 99.5%. These results expose a significant privacy vulnerability that threatens key properties of secure elections, including voter secrecy and protection against coercion or vote-buying. We explore mitigations to our attacks, demonstrating that countermeasures such as payload padding and timestamp equalization can substantially limit their effectiveness.</p></details> | Accepted at ISC 2025 |
| **[Improving Internet Traffic Matrix Prediction via Time Series Clustering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15072v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a novel framework that leverages time series clustering to improve internet traffic matrix (TM) prediction using deep learning (DL) models. Traffic flows within a TM often exhibit diverse temporal behaviors, which can hinder prediction accuracy when training a single model across all flows. To address this, we propose two clustering strategies, source clustering and histogram clustering, that group flows with similar temporal patterns prior to model training. Clustering creates more homogeneous data subsets, enabling models to capture underlying patterns more effectively and generalize better than global prediction approaches that fit a single model to the entire TM. Compared to existing TM prediction methods, our method reduces RMSE by up to 92\% for Abilene and 75\% for G\'EANT. In routing scenarios, our clustered predictions also reduce maximum link utilization (MLU) bias by 18\% and 21\%, respectively, demonstrating the practical benefits of clustering when TMs are used for network optimization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICMLA 2025</p></details> |
| **[Traffic Co-Simulation Framework Empowered by Infrastructure Camera Sensing and Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03925v2)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic simulations are commonly used to optimize urban traffic flow, with reinforcement learning (RL) showing promising potential for automated traffic signal control, particularly in intelligent transportation systems involving connected automated vehicles. Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is particularly effective for learning control strategies for traffic lights in a network using iterative simulations. However, existing methods often assume perfect vehicle detection, which overlooks real-world limitations related to infrastructure availability and sensor reliability. This study proposes a co-simulation framework integrating CARLA and SUMO, which combines high-fidelity 3D modeling with large-scale traffic flow simulation. Cameras mounted on traffic light poles within the CARLA environment use a YOLO-based computer vision system to detect and count vehicles, providing real-time traffic data as input for adaptive signal control in SUMO. MARL agents trained with four different reward structures leverage this visual feedback to optimize signal timings and improve network-wide traffic flow. Experiments in a multi-intersection test-bed demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed MARL approach in enhancing traffic conditions using real-time camera based detection. The framework also evaluates the robustness of MARL under faulty or sparse sensing and compares the performance of YOLOv5 and YOLOv8 for vehicle detection. Results show that while better accuracy improves performance, MARL agents can still achieve significant improvements with imperfect detection, demonstrating scalability and adaptability for real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reconstructing Physics-Informed Machine Learning for Traffic Flow Modeling: a Multi-Gradient Descent and Pareto Learning Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13241v3)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Physics-informed machine learning (PIML) is crucial in modern traffic flow modeling because it combines the benefits of both physics-based and data-driven approaches. In conventional PIML, physical information is typically incorporated by constructing a hybrid loss function that combines data-driven loss and physics loss through linear scalarization. The goal is to find a trade-off between these two objectives to improve the accuracy of model predictions. However, from a mathematical perspective, linear scalarization is limited to identifying only the convex region of the Pareto front, as it treats data-driven and physics losses as separate objectives. Given that most PIML loss functions are non-convex, linear scalarization restricts the achievable trade-off solutions. Moreover, tuning the weighting coefficients for the two loss components can be both time-consuming and computationally challenging. To address these limitations, this paper introduces a paradigm shift in PIML by reformulating the training process as a multi-objective optimization problem, treating data-driven loss and physics loss independently. We apply several multi-gradient descent algorithms (MGDAs), including traditional multi-gradient descent (TMGD) and dual cone gradient descent (DCGD), to explore the Pareto front in this multi-objective setting. These methods are evaluated on both macroscopic and microscopic traffic flow models. In the macroscopic case, MGDAs achieved comparable performance to traditional linear scalarization methods. Notably, in the microscopic case, MGDAs significantly outperformed their scalarization-based counterparts, demonstrating the advantages of a multi-objective optimization approach in complex PIML scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Electroencephalogram (EEG) and eye-tracking features, extracted from an open-source dataset, were used to train and evaluate both conventional machine learning models and SNNs. Among the SNN architectures explored, a minimalistic, single-layer model trained with a biologically inspired delta-rule learning algorithm achieved competitive performance (80.6%). To enable deployment on neuromorphic hardware, the model was quantized and implemented on the mixed-signal DYNAP-SE chip. Despite hardware constraints and analog variability, the chip-deployed SNN maintained a classification accuracy of up to 73.5% using spike-based input. These results demonstrate the feasibility of event-driven neuromorphic systems for ultra-low-power, embedded cognitive state monitoring in dynamic real-world scenarios.</p></details> | 8 pages |
| **[Confidence Driven Classification of Application Types in the Presence of Background Network Traffic](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03891v4)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately classifying the application types of network traffic using deep learning models has recently gained popularity. However, we find that these classifiers do not perform well on real-world traffic data due to the presence of non-application-specific generic background traffic originating from advertisements, analytics, shared APIs, and trackers. Unfortunately, state-of-the-art application classifiers overlook such traffic in curated datasets and only classify relevant application traffic. To address this issue, when we label and train using an additional class for background traffic, it leads to additional confusion between application and background traffic, as the latter is heterogeneous and encompasses all traffic that is not relevant to the application sessions. To avoid falsely classifying background traffic as one of the relevant application types, a reliable confidence measure is warranted, such that we can refrain from classifying uncertain samples. Therefore, we design a Gaussian Mixture Model-based classification framework that improves the indication of the deep learning classifier's confidence to allow more reliable classification.</p></details> | Added Grant Info |
| **[Traffic-Oblivious Multi-Commodity Flow Network Design](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16744v2)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the Minimum Multi-Commodity Flow Subgraph (MMCFS) problem: given a directed graph $G$ with edge capacities $\mathit{cap}$ and a retention ratio $\alpha\in(0,1)$, find an edge-wise minimum subgraph $G' \subseteq G$ such that for all traffic matrices $T$ routable in $G$ using a multi-commodity flow, $\alpha\cdot T$ is routable in $G'$. This natural yet novel problem is motivated by recent research that investigates how the power consumption in backbone computer networks can be reduced by turning off connections during times of low demand without compromising the quality of service. Since the actual traffic demands are generally not known beforehand, our approach must be traffic-oblivious, i.e., work for all possible sets of simultaneously routable traffic demands in the original network. In this paper we present the problem, relate it to other known problems in literature, and show several structural results, including a reformulation, maximum possible deviations from the optimum, and NP-hardness (as well as a certain inapproximability) already on very restricted instances. The most significant contribution is a $\max(\frac{1}{\alpha}, 2)$-approximation based on a surprisingly simple LP-rounding scheme. We also give instances where this worst-case approximation ratio is met and thus prove that our analysis is tight.</p></details> | <details><summary>Appea...</summary><p>Appears in the Proceedings of the 36th International Symposium on Algorithms and Computation (ISAAC 2025)</p></details> |

Collecting and transferring complete traces in real time is a significant challenge. We present a compact traffic generator that combines hidden Markov model, capturing the broad rhythms of buffering, streaming and idle periods, with a small feed forward mixture density network that generates realistic payload sizes and inter-arrival times to be fed to the DT. This traffic generator trains in seconds on a server GPU, runs in real time and can be fine tuned inside the DT whenever the statistics of the generated data do not match the actual traffic. This enables operators to keep their DT up to date without causing overhead to the operational network. The results show that the traffic generator presented is able to derive realistic packet traces of payload length and inter-arrival time across various metrics that assess distributional fidelity, diversity, and temporal correlation of the synthetic trace.</p></details> |  |
| **[Travel Time and Weather-Aware Traffic Forecasting in a Conformal Graph Neural Network Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12043v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic flow forecasting is essential for managing congestion, improving safety, and optimizing various transportation systems. However, it remains a prevailing challenge due to the stochastic nature of urban traffic and environmental factors. Better predictions require models capable of accommodating the traffic variability influenced by multiple dynamic and complex interdependent factors. In this work, we propose a Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework to address the stochasticity by leveraging adaptive adjacency matrices using log-normal distributions and Coefficient of Variation (CV) values to reflect real-world travel time variability. Additionally, weather factors such as temperature, wind speed, and precipitation adjust edge weights and enable GNN to capture evolving spatio-temporal dependencies across traffic stations. This enhancement over the static adjacency matrix allows the model to adapt effectively to traffic stochasticity and changing environmental conditions. Furthermore, we utilize the Adaptive Conformal Prediction (ACP) framework to provide reliable uncertainty quantification, achieving target coverage while maintaining acceptable prediction intervals. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model, in comparison with baseline methods, showed better prediction accuracy and uncertainty bounds. We, then, validate this method by constructing traffic scenarios in SUMO and applying Monte-Carlo simulation to derive a travel time distribution for a Vehicle Under Test (VUT) to reflect real-world variability. The simulated mean travel time of the VUT falls within the intervals defined by INRIX historical data, verifying the model's robustness.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript has been accepted as a REGULAR PAPER in the Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems 2025</p></details> |

We present \textbf{HybridMamba}, a novel architecture integrating visual transformers with state-space temporal modeling to achieve high-precision crash time localization. Our approach introduces multi-level token compression and hierarchical temporal processing to maintain computational efficiency without sacrificing temporal resolution. Evaluated on a large-scale dataset from the Iowa Department of Transportation, HybridMamba achieves a mean absolute error of \textbf{1.50 seconds} for 2-minute videos ($p<0.01$ compared to baselines), with \textbf{65.2%} of predictions falling within one second of the ground truth. It outperforms recent video-language models (e.g., TimeChat, VideoLLaMA-2) by up to 3.95 seconds while using significantly fewer parameters (3B vs. 13--72B). Our results demonstrate effective temporal localization across various video durations (2--40 minutes) and diverse environmental conditions, highlighting HybridMamba's potential for fine-grained temporal localization in traffic surveillance while identifying challenges that remain for extended deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Taming Spontaneous Stop-and-Go Traffic Waves: A Bifurcation Perspective of A Dynamical Map](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09466v2)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider a discrete-time dynamical system in a car-following context. The system was recently introduced to parsimoniously model human driving behavior based on utility maximization. The parameters of the model were calibrated using vehicle trajectory data from the Sugiyama experiment. It was shown that such a system can accurately reproduce the observed collective phenomena of a more elaborate experiment by Tadaki et al. Once the heterogeneity and noise are switched off, the model defines a map of the corresponding discrete-time dynamical system. We first perform a bifurcation analysis of the map by studying the stability of its limit solutions: a free-flow fixed point and a stop-and-go quasi-periodic orbit. When the vehicle density is varied, our model displays a bifurcation diagram qualitatively similar to those found in a class of optimal velocity models based on an ordinary differential equation approach, including regimes where one or both of the limit solutions are stable. In a 2D bifurcation diagram we further demonstrate that imposing a vehicle density-dependent speed advisory can dissipate the stop-and-go quasi-periodic orbit. This in turn lays the mathematical foundation for a simple, yet effective proposal [1] to tame stop-and-go waves, improving traffic flow and smoothness simultaneously via variable speed advisory.</p></details> |  |
| **[Taming Spontaneous Stop-and-Go Traffic Waves: A Computational Mechanism Design Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09441v2)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>It is well known that stop-and-go waves can be generated spontaneously in traffic even without bottlenecks. Can such undesirable traffic patterns, induced by intrinsic human driving behaviors, be tamed effectively and inexpensively? Taking advantage of emerging connectivity and autonomy technologies, we envision a simple yet realistic traffic control system to achieve this goal. To prove the concept, we design such a system to suppress these waves while maximizing traffic throughput in the Tadaki setting: a circular road with varying number of vehicles. We first introduce our driver behavior model and demonstrate how our calibrated human driving agents can closely reproduce the observed human driving patterns in the original Tadaki experiment. We then propose a simple control system mediated via connected automated vehicles (CAV) whose ideal speed parameter is treated as a system-level control variable adapted to the local vehicle density of the traffic. The objective of the control system is set up as a tradeoff: maximizing throughput while minimizing traffic oscillation. Following computational mechanism design, we search for the optimal control policy as a function of vehicle density and the tradeoff attitude parameter. This can be done by letting all vehicles play a simulated game of CAV-modulated traffic under such a control system. Our simulation results show that the improvements in traffic efficiency and smoothness are substantial. Finally, we envision how such a traffic control system can be realized in an environment with smart vehicles connected to a smart infrastructure or via a scheme of variable speed advisory.</p></details> |  |

Yet, existing approaches face notable challenges in accurately modeling spatiotemporal causality and integrating domain-specific knowledge, limiting their effectiveness in complex scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose Traffic-MLLM, a multimodal large language model tailored for fine-grained traffic analysis. Built on the Qwen2.5-VL backbone, our model leverages high-quality traffic-specific multimodal datasets and uses Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for lightweight fine-tuning, significantly enhancing its capacity to model continuous spatiotemporal features in video sequences. Furthermore, we introduce an innovative knowledge prompting module fusing Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), enabling precise injection of detailed traffic regulations and domain knowledge into the inference process. This design markedly boosts the model's logical reasoning and knowledge adaptation capabilities. Experimental results on TrafficQA and DriveQA benchmarks show Traffic-MLLM achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating its superior ability to process multimodal traffic data. It also exhibits remarkable zero-shot reasoning and cross-scenario generalization capabilities.</p></details> |  |

Existing sequence modeling approaches can be broadly categorized into flow-level and trace-level methods: the former suffer from high feature redundancy, limiting their discriminative power, whereas the latter preserve complete information but incur substantial computational and storage overhead. To address these limitations, we propose the \textbf{U}p-\textbf{D}own \textbf{F}low \textbf{S}equence (\textbf{UDFS}) representation, which compresses an entire trace into a two-dimensional sequence and characterizes each flow by the aggregate of its upstream and downstream traffic, reducing complexity while maintaining high discriminability. Furthermore, to address the challenge of class-specific discriminability differences, we propose an adaptive threshold mechanism that dynamically adjusts training weights and rejection boundaries, enhancing the model's classification performance.

| **[Potential failures of physics-informed machine learning in traffic flow modeling: theoretical and experimental analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11491v2)** | 2025-09-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study investigates why physics-informed machine learning (PIML) can fail in macroscopic traffic flow modeling. We define failure as cases where a PIML model underperforms both purely data-driven and purely physics-based baselines by a given threshold. Unlike in other fields, physics residuals themselves do not hinder optimization in this setting. Instead, effective updates require both data and physics gradients to form acute angles with the true gradient, a condition difficult to satisfy with low-resolution loop data. In such cases, neural networks cannot accurately approximate density and speed, and the constructed physics residuals, already degraded by discrete sampling and temporal averaging, lose their ability to capture PDE dynamics, which directly leads to PIML failure. Theoretically, although LWR and ARZ solutions are weak solutions, for piecewise $C^k$ initial data they remain $C^k$ off the shock set under mild conditions, which has Lebesgue measure zero. Thus, almost all detector or collocation points lie in smooth regions where residuals are valid, and the MLP's inability to exactly represent discontinuities is immaterial. Finally, we establish MSE lower bounds of physics residuals: higher-order models such as ARZ have strictly larger consistency error bounds than LWR under mild conditions. This explains why LWR-based PIML can outperform ARZ-based PIML even with high-resolution data, with the gap shrinking as resolution increases, consistent with prior empirical findings.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Hybrid Optimal Velocity Drag Model for Traffic Flow Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22671v1)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We develop a Hybrid Optimal Velocity-Drag (OVD) model that combines the behavioral structure of the classical Optimal Velocity Model (OVM) with a drag-based saturation law motivated by Newtonian mechanics. The model retains the OVM principle that desired speed depends on headway, but replaces the linear relaxation law with a formulation that enforces bounded accelerations and smooth convergence to equilibrium. After reviewing the OVM framework and its stability properties, we introduce the OVD dynamics and derive the dispersion relation from a linear stability analysis of uniform flow. This analysis shows that the OVD formulation preserves the instability mechanisms responsible for stop-and-go waves, while avoiding the unrealistic acceleration predictions of the classical OVM. We also illustrate the model using desired velocity functions of hyperbolic tangent type, a common choice in the OVM literature, and highlight applications to large-scale traffic simulation and empirical data studies. Taken together, our results demonstrate that the OVD model enforces bounded accelerations while preserving the nonlinear instabilities of the classical OVM, providing a physically grounded and interpretable foundation for advancing traffic flow research.</p></details> | 18 pages, 7 figures |
| **[HiLight: A Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning Framework with Global Adversarial Guidance for Large-Scale Traffic Signal Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14391v2)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficient traffic signal control (TSC) is essential for mitigating urban congestion, yet existing reinforcement learning (RL) methods face challenges in scaling to large networks while maintaining global coordination. Centralized RL suffers from scalability issues, while decentralized approaches often lack unified objectives, resulting in limited network-level efficiency. In this paper, we propose HiLight, a hierarchical reinforcement learning framework with global adversarial guidance for large-scale TSC. HiLight consists of a high-level Meta-Policy, which partitions the traffic network into subregions and generates sub-goals using a Transformer-LSTM architecture, and a low-level Sub-Policy, which controls individual intersections with global awareness. To improve the alignment between global planning and local execution, we introduce an adversarial training mechanism, where the Meta-Policy generates challenging yet informative sub-goals, and the Sub-Policy learns to surpass these targets, leading to more effective coordination. We evaluate HiLight across both synthetic and real-world benchmarks, and additionally construct a large-scale Manhattan network with diverse traffic conditions, including peak transitions, adverse weather, and holiday surges. Experimental results show that HiLight exhibits significant advantages in large-scale scenarios and remains competitive across standard benchmarks of varying sizes.</p></details> |  |

Evaluating Benign Traffic in Intrusion Detection Datasets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09564v1)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Supervised machine learning techniques rely on labeled data to achieve high task performance, but this requires the labels to capture some meaningful differences in the underlying data structure. For training network intrusion detection algorithms, most datasets contain a series of attack classes and a single large benign class which captures all non-attack network traffic. A review of intrusion detection papers and guides that explicitly state their data preprocessing steps identified that the majority took the labeled categories of the dataset at face value when training their algorithms. The present paper evaluates the structure of benign traffic in several common intrusion detection datasets (NSL-KDD, UNSW-NB15, and CIC-IDS 2017) and determines whether there are meaningful sub-categories within this traffic which may improve overall multi-classification performance using common machine learning techniques. We present an overview of some unsupervised clustering techniques (e.g., HDBSCAN, Mean Shift Clustering) and show how they differentially cluster the benign traffic space.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages; accepted to SBP-BRiMS 2025 Poster Session</p></details> |

This paper presents PARROT, a reproducible and portable traffic capture system for systematic app traffic collection using Android Virtual Devices. The system provides automated environment setup, configurable Android versions, traffic recording management, and labeled captures extraction with human-in-the-loop app interaction. PARROT integrates mitmproxy for optional traffic decryption with automated SSL/TLS key extraction, supporting flexible capture modes with or without traffic interception. We collected a dataset of 80 apps selected from the MAppGraph dataset list, providing traffic captures with corresponding SSL keys for decryption analysis. Our comparative analysis between the MAppGraph dataset (2021) and our dataset (2025) reveals app traffic pattern evolution across 50 common apps. Key findings include migration from TLSv1.2 to TLSv1.3 protocol, with TLSv1.3 comprising 90.0\% of TCP encrypted traffic in 2025 compared to 6.7\% in 2021. QUIC protocol adoption increased substantially, with all 50 common apps generating QUIC traffic under normal network conditions compared to 30 apps in 2021. DNS communications evolved from predominantly unencrypted Do53 protocol (91.0\% in 2021) to encrypted DoT protocol (81.1\% in 2025). The open-source PARROT system enables reproducible app traffic capture for research community adoption and provides insights into app security protocol evolution.</p></details> |  |
| **[MITS: A Large-Scale Multimodal Benchmark Dataset for Intelligent Traffic Surveillance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09730v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>General-domain large multimodal models (LMMs) have achieved significant advances in various image-text tasks. However, their performance in the Intelligent Traffic Surveillance (ITS) domain remains limited due to the absence of dedicated multimodal datasets. To address this gap, we introduce MITS (Multimodal Intelligent Traffic Surveillance), the first large-scale multimodal benchmark dataset specifically designed for ITS. MITS includes 170,400 independently collected real-world ITS images sourced from traffic surveillance cameras, annotated with eight main categories and 24 subcategories of ITS-specific objects and events under diverse environmental conditions. Additionally, through a systematic data generation pipeline, we generate high-quality image captions and 5 million instruction-following visual question-answer pairs, addressing five critical ITS tasks: object and event recognition, object counting, object localization, background analysis, and event reasoning. To demonstrate MITS's effectiveness, we fine-tune mainstream LMMs on this dataset, enabling the development of ITS-specific applications. Experimental results show that MITS significantly improves LMM performance in ITS applications, increasing LLaVA-1.5's performance from 0.494 to 0.905 (+83.2%), LLaVA-1.6's from 0.678 to 0.921 (+35.8%), Qwen2-VL's from 0.584 to 0.926 (+58.6%), and Qwen2.5-VL's from 0.732 to 0.930 (+27.0%). We release the dataset, code, and models as open-source, providing high-value resources to advance both ITS and LMM research.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by Image and Vision Computing</p></details> |

If a planned trajectory violates traffic rules, it is common to replan a new trajectory from scratch. We instead propose a trajectory repair technique to save computation time. By coupling satisfiability modulo theories with set-based reachability analysis, we determine if and in what manner the initial trajectory can be repaired. Experiments in high-fidelity simulators and in the real world demonstrate the benefits of our proposed approach in various scenarios. Even in complex environments with intricate rules, we efficiently and reliably repair rule-violating trajectories, enabling automated vehicles to swiftly resume legally safe operation in real time.</p></details> | <details><summary>2025 ...</summary><p>2025 IEEE.

Admission control in this setting is cast as a stochastic shortest path problem, with state space derived from (discretization of) the elastic flow's size/deadline and action space corresponding to alternative subsets of admitted inelastic flows: the probabilistic model expresses uncertainty in both the link's available bandwidth and the inelastic flows' offered loads, while the objective function captures both congestion avoidance and the option to specify a desired minimum elastic rate. Its solution is shown to (i) balance the accumulation of instantaneous inelastic reward with the risk of missing the elastic deadline and (ii) exhibit a degree of robustness to link & flow modeling errors that is tunable via choice of the desired minimum elastic rate. Also discussed are state augmentations that befit urgent or non-interruptible inelastic traffic.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 12 figures, unpublished/rejected manuscript circa 2018</p></details> |

While prior work has primarily focused on MNIST and similar datasets, this paper investigates the vulnerability of traffic sign classifiers using the LISA Traffic Sign dataset. We train a convolutional neural network to classify 47 different traffic signs and evaluate its robustness against Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) and Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) attacks. Our results show a sharp decline in classification accuracy as the perturbation magnitude increases, highlighting the models susceptibility to adversarial examples. This study lays the groundwork for future exploration into defense mechanisms tailored for real-world traffic sign recognition systems.</p></details> |  |

This paper leverages publicly available Internet Exchange Point traffic statistics to address this gap, presenting a comprehensive two-year study (2023-2024) from 472 IXPs worldwide, capturing approximately 300 Tbps of peak daily aggregate traffic by late 2024. Our analysis reveals a 49.2% global traffic increase (24.5% annualized), uncovers regionally distinct diurnal patterns and event-driven anomalies, and demonstrates stable utilization rates, reflecting predictable infrastructure scaling. By analyzing biases and confirming high self-similarity, we establish IXP traffic as a robust proxy for overall Internet growth and usage behavior. With transparent, replicable data--covering 87% of the worldwide IXP port capacity--and plans to release our dataset, this study offers a verifiable foundation for long-term Internet traffic monitoring. In particular, our findings shed light on the interplay between network design and function, providing an accessible framework for researchers and operators to explore the Internet's evolving ecosystem.</p></details> | 15 pages, 16 figures |
| **[Numerical optimization of aviation decarbonization scenarios: balancing traffic and emissions with maturing energy carriers and aircraft technology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22435v2)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite being considered a hard-to-abate sector, aviation's emissions will play an important role in long-term climate mitigation of transportation. The introduction of low-carbon energy carriers and the deployment of new aircraft in the current fleet are modeled as technology-centered decarbonization policies, while supply constraints in targeted market segments are modeled as demand-side policies. Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) are used to estimate trend traffic demand and to limit the sectoral consumption of electricity and biomass. Mitigation scenarios are formulated as optimization problems, and three applications are demonstrated: no-policy baselines, single-policy optimization, and scenario-robust policies. Results show that the choice of energy carrier is highly dependent on assumptions regarding aircraft technology and the background energy system. Across all SSP-based scenarios, emissions peak by around 2040, but achieving alignment with the Paris Agreement requires either targeted demand management or additional low-carbon energy supply. The use of gradient-based optimization within a multidisciplinary framework enables the efficient resolution of these nonlinear, high-dimensional problems while reducing implementation effort.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bridge Modal Identification using Single Moving Sensor under Random Traffic Loading](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05277v1)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper explores the feasibility of utilizing the response recorded by a single moving sensor to identify the modal parameters of a bridge system under different loading conditions, such as known excitation and unknown random traffic-induced vibrations. The sensor traverses the bridge and captures its dynamic response (acceleration). The natural frequencies and damping ratios are identified using the moving sensor data in the frequency domain. In the case of known inputs, these parameters are then used to obtain the mode shapes, expressed as a linear combination of basic orthonormal polynomials (BOPs), with the coefficients of the BOPs in the linear combinations obtained via optimization. A statistical formulation is proposed to estimate the mode shapes in the case of unknown random traffic-induced vibrations, including the effect of road roughness. It is shown that the absolute value of the mode shapes are proportional to the ensemble standard deviation (SD) of the modal responses. This approach requires the sensor to traverse the bridge multiple times, with the mode shapes identified in both the time domain using variances, and in frequency domain through the evolutionary power spectrum of these responses. The random traffic loading is modeled such that vehicle arrival times follow a Poisson distribution, while the mass and velocity of the vehicles are assumed to follow uniform distributions. To incorporate the effect of road roughness, modeled as a homogeneous random field, a vehicle-bridge-interaction (VBI) model is utilized. Numerical validation under the different loading conditions demonstrates that a single moving sensor can be used to identify the modal parameters quite accurately, with high spatial resolution of the identified mode shapes, offering a cost-effective and efficient alternative for bridge health monitoring.</p></details> | 56 pages, 18 figures |
| **[Using Causality for Enhanced Prediction of Web Traffic Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00612v2)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting web service traffic has significant social value, as it can be applied to various practical scenarios, including but not limited to dynamic resource scaling, load balancing, system anomaly detection, service-level agreement compliance, and fraud detection. Web service traffic is characterized by frequent and drastic fluctuations over time and are influenced by heterogeneous web user behaviors, making accurate prediction a challenging task. Previous research has extensively explored statistical approaches, and neural networks to mine features from preceding service traffic time series for prediction. However, these methods have largely overlooked the causal relationships between services. Drawing inspiration from causality in ecological systems, we empirically recognize the causal relationships between web services. To leverage these relationships for improved web service traffic prediction, we propose an effective neural network module, CCMPlus, designed to extract causal relationship features across services. This module can be seamlessly integrated with existing time series models to consistently enhance the performance of web service traffic predictions. We theoretically justify that the causal correlation matrix generated by the CCMPlus module captures causal relationships among services. Empirical results on real-world datasets from Microsoft Azure, Alibaba Group, and Ant Group confirm that our method surpasses state-of-the-art approaches in Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) for predicting service traffic time series. These findings highlight the efficacy of leveraging causal relationships for improved predictions.</p></details> | <details><summary>time ...</summary><p>time series, web service, web traffic, causality, more experiments</p></details> |
| **[A biologically inspired separable learning vision model for real-time traffic object perception in Dark](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05012v1)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fast and accurate object perception in low-light traffic scenes has attracted increasing attention. However, due to severe illumination degradation and the lack of reliable visual cues, existing perception models and methods struggle to quickly adapt to and accurately predict in low-light environments. Moreover, there is the absence of available large-scale benchmark specifically focused on low-light traffic scenes. To bridge this gap, we introduce a physically grounded illumination degradation method tailored to real-world low-light settings and construct Dark-traffic, the largest densely annotated dataset to date for low-light traffic scenes, supporting object detection, instance segmentation, and optical flow estimation. We further propose the Separable Learning Vision Model (SLVM), a biologically inspired framework designed to enhance perception under adverse lighting. SLVM integrates four key components: a light-adaptive pupillary mechanism for illumination-sensitive feature extraction, a feature-level separable learning strategy for efficient representation, task-specific decoupled branches for multi-task separable learning, and a spatial misalignment-aware fusion module for precise multi-feature alignment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SLVM achieves state-of-the-art performance with reduced computational overhead. Notably, it outperforms RT-DETR by 11.2 percentage points in detection, YOLOv12 by 6.1 percentage points in instance segmentation, and reduces endpoint error (EPE) of baseline by 12.37% on Dark-traffic. On the LIS benchmark, the end-to-end trained SLVM surpasses Swin Transformer+EnlightenGAN and ConvNeXt-T+EnlightenGAN by an average of 11 percentage points across key metrics, and exceeds Mask RCNN (with light enhancement) by 3.1 percentage points. The Dark-traffic dataset and complete code is released at https://github.com/alanli1997/slvm.</p></details> |  |

Traditional traffic monitoring systems, such as fixed cameras and sensor-based methods, are often constrained by limited coverage, low adaptability, and poor scalability. To address these challenges, this paper introduces an advanced unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based traffic surveillance system capable of accurate vehicle detection, classification, tracking, and behavioral analysis in real-world, unconstrained urban environments. The system leverages multi-scale and multi-angle template matching, Kalman filtering, and homography-based calibration to process aerial video data collected from altitudes of approximately 200 meters. A case study in urban area demonstrates robust performance, achieving a detection precision of 91.8%, an F1-score of 90.5%, and tracking metrics (MOTA/MOTP) of 92.1% and 93.7%, respectively. Beyond precise detection, the system classifies five vehicle types and automatically detects critical traffic violations, including unsafe lane changes, illegal double parking, and crosswalk obstructions, through the fusion of geofencing, motion filtering, and trajectory deviation analysis. The integrated analytics module supports origin-destination tracking, vehicle count visualization, inter-class correlation analysis, and heatmap-based congestion modeling. Additionally, the system enables entry-exit trajectory profiling, vehicle density estimation across road segments, and movement direction logging, supporting comprehensive multi-scale urban mobility analytics. Experimental results confirms the system's scalability, accuracy, and practical relevance, highlighting its potential as an enforcement-aware, infrastructure-independent traffic monitoring solution for next-generation smart cities.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 8 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

Our approach uses Fourier neural operators to learn macroscopic traffic flow dynamics from high-fidelity data. During inference, the operator functions as an open-loop predictor of traffic evolution. To close the loop, we couple the open-loop operator with a correction operator that combines the predicted density with sparse measurements from the sensors. Simulations with the SUMO software indicate that, compared to open-loop observers, the proposed closed-loop observer exhibits classical closed-loop properties such as robustness to noise and ultimate boundedness of the error. This shows the advantages of combining learned physics with real-time corrections, and opens avenues for accurate, efficient, and interpretable data-driven observers.</p></details> |  |
| **[Safety-Critical Multi-Agent MCTS for Mixed Traffic Coordination at Unsignalized Roundabout](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01856v2)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Decision-making at unsignalized roundabouts poses substantial challenges for autonomous vehicles (AVs), particularly in mixed traffic environments where AVs must coordinate safely with human-driven vehicles (HDVs). This paper presents a safety-critical multi-agent Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) framework that integrates both deterministic and probabilistic prediction models to facilitate cooperative decision-making in complex roundabout scenarios. The proposed framework introduces three key innovations: (1) a hierarchical safety assessment module that systematically addresses AV-to-AV (A2A), AV-to-HDV (A2H), and AV-to-Road (A2R) interactions through dynamic safety thresholds and spatiotemporal risk evaluation; (2) an adaptive HDV behavior prediction scheme that combines the Intelligent Driver Model (IDM) with probabilistic uncertainty modeling; and (3) a multi-objective reward optimization strategy that jointly considers safety, efficiency, and cooperative intent. Extensive simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach under both fully autonomous (100% AVs) and mixed traffic (50% AVs + 50% HDVs) conditions. Compared to benchmark methods, our framework consistently reduces trajectory deviations across all AVs and significantly lowers the rate of Post-Encroachment Time (PET) violations, achieving only 1.0\% in the fully autonomous scenario and 3.2% in the mixed traffic setting.</p></details> | 12 pages, 10 figures |

This paper reviews 147 recent studies, focusing on the application of supervised, unsupervised, and hybrid deep learning models for accident prediction, alongside the use of real-world and synthetic datasets. Current methodologies are categorized into four key approaches: image and video feature-based prediction, spatio-temporal feature-based prediction, scene understanding, and multi modal data fusion. While these methods demonstrate significant potential, challenges such as data scarcity, limited generalization to complex scenarios, and real-time performance constraints remain prevalent. This review highlights opportunities for future research, including the integration of multi modal data fusion, self-supervised learning, and Transformer-based architectures to enhance prediction accuracy and scalability. By synthesizing existing advancements and identifying critical gaps, this paper provides a foundational reference for developing robust and adaptive Vision-TAA systems, contributing to road safety and traffic management.</p></details> |  |

However, its design depends on hand-crafted formulas (e.g., Webster) and manual re-timing by engineers to adapt to demand changes, which is labor-intensive and often yields suboptimal results under heterogeneous or congested conditions. This paper introduces the EvolveSignal, a large language models (LLMs) powered coding agent to automatically discover new traffic signal control algorithms. We formulate the problem as program synthesis, where candidate algorithms are represented as Python functions with fixed input-output structures, and iteratively optimized through external evaluations (e.g., a traffic simulator) and evolutionary search. Experiments on a signalized intersection demonstrate that the discovered algorithms outperform Webster's baseline, reducing average delay by 20.1% and average stops by 47.1%. Beyond performance, ablation and incremental analyses reveal that EvolveSignal modifications-such as adjusting cycle length bounds, incorporating right-turn demand, and rescaling green allocations-can offer practically meaningful insights for traffic engineers. This work opens a new research direction by leveraging AI for algorithm design in traffic signal control, bridging program synthesis with transportation engineering.</p></details> |  |

| **[Neural Canonical Polyadic Factorization for Traffic Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15079v4)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern intelligent transportation systems rely on accurate spatiotemporal traffic analysis to optimize urban mobility and infrastructure resilience. However, pervasive missing data caused by sensor failures and heterogeneous sensing gaps fundamentally hinders reliable traffic modeling. This paper proposes a Neural Canonical Polyadic Factorization (NCPF) model that synergizes low-rank tensor algebra with deep representation learning for robust traffic data imputation. The model innovatively embeds CP decomposition into neural architecture through learnable embedding projections, where sparse traffic tensors are encoded into dense latent factors across road segments, time intervals, and mobility metrics. A hierarchical feature fusion mechanism employs Hadamard products to explicitly model multilinear interactions, while stacked multilayer perceptron layers nonlinearly refine these representations to capture complex spatiotemporal couplings. Extensive evaluations on six urban traffic datasets demonstrate NCPF's superiority over six state-of-the-art baselines. By unifying CP decomposition's interpretable factor analysis with neural network's nonlinear expressive power, NCPF provides a principled yet flexible approaches for high-dimensional traffic data imputation, offering critical support for next-generation transportation digital twins and adaptive traffic control systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Hierarchical Deep Reinforcement Learning Framework for Traffic Signal Control with Predictable Cycle Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03118v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has become a popular approach in traffic signal control (TSC) due to its ability to learn adaptive policies from complex traffic environments. Within DRL-based TSC methods, two primary control paradigms are ``choose phase" and ``switch" strategies. Although the agent in the choose phase paradigm selects the next active phase adaptively, this paradigm may result in unexpected phase sequences for drivers, disrupting their anticipation and potentially compromising safety at intersections. Meanwhile, the switch paradigm allows the agent to decide whether to switch to the next predefined phase or extend the current phase. While this structure maintains a more predictable order, it can lead to unfair and inefficient phase allocations, as certain movements may be extended disproportionately while others are neglected. In this paper, we propose a DRL model, named Deep Hierarchical Cycle Planner (DHCP), to allocate the traffic signal cycle duration hierarchically. A high-level agent first determines the split of the total cycle time between the North-South (NS) and East-West (EW) directions based on the overall traffic state. Then, a low-level agent further divides the allocated duration within each major direction between straight and left-turn movements, enabling more flexible durations for the two movements. We test our model on both real and synthetic road networks, along with multiple sets of real and synthetic traffic flows. Empirical results show our model achieves the best performance over all datasets against baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Automatically Generating High-Precision Simulated Road Networking in Traffic Scenario](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02990v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing lane-level simulation road network generation is labor-intensive, resource-demanding, and costly due to the need for large-scale data collection and manual post-editing. To overcome these limitations, we propose automatically generating high-precision simulated road networks in traffic scenario, an efficient and fully automated solution. Initially, real-world road street view data is collected through open-source street view map platforms, and a large-scale street view lane line dataset is constructed to provide a robust foundation for subsequent analysis. Next, an end-to-end lane line detection approach based on deep learning is designed, where a neural network model is trained to accurately detect the number and spatial distribution of lane lines in street view images, enabling automated extraction of lane information. Subsequently, by integrating coordinate transformation and map matching algorithms, the extracted lane information from street views is fused with the foundational road topology obtained from open-source map service platforms, resulting in the generation of a high-precision lane-level simulation road network. This method significantly reduces the costs associated with data collection and manual editing while enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of simulation road network generation. It provides reliable data support for urban traffic simulation, autonomous driving navigation, and the development of intelligent transportation systems, offering a novel technical pathway for the automated modeling of large-scale urban road networks.</p></details> | 7 pages,11 figures |
| **[Diffusion-RL Based Air Traffic Conflict Detection and Resolution Method](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03550v1)** | 2025-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the context of continuously rising global air traffic, efficient and safe Conflict Detection and Resolution (CD&R) is paramount for air traffic management. Although Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) offers a promising pathway for CD&R automation, existing approaches commonly suffer from a "unimodal bias" in their policies. This leads to a critical lack of decision-making flexibility when confronted with complex and dynamic constraints, often resulting in "decision deadlocks." To overcome this limitation, this paper pioneers the integration of diffusion probabilistic models into the safety-critical task of CD&R, proposing a novel autonomous conflict resolution framework named Diffusion-AC. Diverging from conventional methods that converge to a single optimal solution, our framework models its policy as a reverse denoising process guided by a value function, enabling it to generate a rich, high-quality, and multimodal action distribution. This core architecture is complemented by a Density-Progressive Safety Curriculum (DPSC), a training mechanism that ensures stable and efficient learning as the agent progresses from sparse to high-density traffic environments. Extensive simulation experiments demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms a suite of state-of-the-art DRL benchmarks. Most critically, in the most challenging high-density scenarios, Diffusion-AC not only maintains a high success rate of 94.1% but also reduces the incidence of Near Mid-Air Collisions (NMACs) by approximately 59% compared to the next-best-performing baseline, significantly enhancing the system's safety margin. This performance leap stems from its unique multimodal decision-making capability, which allows the agent to flexibly switch to effective alternative maneuvers.</p></details> | <details><summary>59 pa...</summary><p>59 pages,13 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

Among operational loads, traffic load plays a pivotal role, and recent advances in deep learning - particularly in computer vision (CV) - have enabled progress toward continuous, automated monitoring. However, CV-based approaches suffer from limitations, including privacy concerns and sensitivity to lighting conditions, while traditional non-vision-based methods often lack flexibility in deployment and validation. To bridge this gap, we propose a fully automated deep-learning pipeline for continuous traffic monitoring using structural health monitoring (SHM) sensor networks. Our approach integrates CV-assisted high-resolution dataset generation with supervised training and inference, leveraging graph neural networks (GNNs) to capture the spatial structure and interdependence of sensor data. By transferring knowledge from CV outputs to SHM sensors, the proposed framework enables sensor networks to achieve comparable accuracy of vision-based systems, with minimal human intervention. Applied to accelerometer and strain gauge data in a real-world case study, the model achieves state-of-the-art performance, with classification accuracies of 99% for light vehicles and 94% for heavy vehicles.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cruise Control: Dynamic Model Selection for ML-Based Network Traffic Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15146v2)** | 2025-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern networks increasingly rely on machine learning models for real-time insights, including traffic classification, application quality of experience inference, and intrusion detection. However, existing approaches prioritize prediction accuracy without considering deployment constraints or the dynamism of network traffic, leading to potentially suboptimal performance. Because of this, deploying ML models in real-world networks with tight performance constraints remains an open challenge. In contrast with existing work that aims to select an optimal candidate model for each task based on offline information, we propose an online, system-driven approach to dynamically select the best ML model for network traffic analysis. To this end, we present Cruise Control, a system that pre-trains several models for a given task with different accuracy-cost tradeoffs and selects the most appropriate model based on lightweight signals representing the system's current traffic processing ability. Experimental results using two real-world traffic analysis tasks demonstrate Cruise Control's effectiveness in adapting to changing network conditions. Our evaluation shows that Cruise Control improves median accuracy by 2.78% while reducing packet loss by a factor of four compared to offline-selected models.</p></details> |  |

We present a segment routing over IPv6 (SRv6) flexible algorithm (Flex-Algo) framework that consists of three logical slices: an energy-efficient slice (Algo 130), a high-reliability slice (Algo 129), and a latency-sensitive slice (Algo 128). The framework provides a unified mixed-integer linear program (MILP) that combines satellite CPU power, packet delivery rate (PDR), and end-to-end latency into a single objective, allowing a lightweight software-defined network (SDN) controller to steer traffic from the source node. Emulation of Telesat's Lightspeed constellation shows that, compared with different routing schemes, the proposed design reduces the average CPU usage by 73%, maintains a PDR above 91% during traffic bursts, and decreases urgent flow delay by 18 ms between Ottawa and Vancouver. The results confirm Flex-Algo's value as a slice-based traffic engineering (TE) tool for resource-constrained satellite networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for at GlobeCom 2025 GCSN</p></details> |

In this context, we introduce in this paper, FlexNGIA 2.0, an Agentic AI-driven Internet architecture that leverages LLM-based AI agents to autonomously orchestrate, configure, and evolve the network. These agents can, at runtime, perceive, reason, coordinate among themselves to dynamically design, implement, deploy, and adapt communication protocols, Service Function Chains (SFCs), network functions, resource allocation strategies, congestion control, and traffic engineering schemes, thereby ensuring optimal performance, reliability, and efficiency under evolving conditions. The paper first outlines the overall architecture of FlexNGIA 2.0 and its constituent LLM-Based AI agents. For each agent, we detail its design, implementation, inputs and outputs, prompt structures, interactions with tools and other agents, followed by preliminary proof-of-concept experiments demonstrating its operation and potential. The results clearly highlight the ability of these LLM-based AI agents to automate the design, the implementation, the deployment, and the performance evaluation of transport protocols, service function chains, network functions, congestion control schemes, and resource allocation strategies. FlexNGIA 2.0 paves the way for a new class of Agentic AI-Driven networks, where fully cognitive, self-evolving AI agents can autonomously design, implement, adapt and optimize the network's protocols, algorithms, and behaviors to efficiently operate across complex, dynamic, and heterogeneous environments. To bring this vision to reality, we also identify key research challenges toward achieving fully autonomous, adaptive, and agentic AI-driven networks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Using iterated local alignment to aggregate trajectory data into a traffic flow map](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17500v6)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vehicle trajectories are a promising GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) data source to compute multi-scale traffic flow maps ranging from the city/regional level to the road level. The main obstacle is that trajectory data are prone to measurement noise. While this is negligible for city level, large-scale flow aggregation, it poses substantial difficulties for road level, small-scale aggregation. To overcome these difficulties, we introduce innovative local alignment algorithms, where we infer road segments to serve as local reference segments, and proceed to align nearby road segments to them. We deploy these algorithms in an iterative workflow to compute locally aligned flow maps. By applying this workflow to synthetic and empirical trajectories, we verify that our locally aligned flow maps provide high levels of accuracy and spatial resolution of flow aggregation at multiple scales for static and interactive maps.</p></details> |  |
| **[Simplifying Traffic Anomaly Detection with Video Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09338v2)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent methods for ego-centric Traffic Anomaly Detection (TAD) often rely on complex multi-stage or multi-representation fusion architectures, yet it remains unclear whether such complexity is necessary. Recent findings in visual perception suggest that foundation models, enabled by advanced pre-training, allow simple yet flexible architectures to outperform specialized designs. Therefore, in this work, we investigate an architecturally simple encoder-only approach using plain Video Vision Transformers (Video ViTs) and study how pre-training enables strong TAD performance. We find that: (i) advanced pre-training enables simple encoder-only models to match or even surpass the performance of specialized state-of-the-art TAD methods, while also being significantly more efficient; (ii) although weakly- and fully-supervised pre-training are advantageous on standard benchmarks, we find them less effective for TAD. Instead, self-supervised Masked Video Modeling (MVM) provides the strongest signal; and (iii) Domain-Adaptive Pre-Training (DAPT) on unlabeled driving videos further improves downstream performance, without requiring anomalous examples. Our findings highlight the importance of pre-training and show that effective, efficient, and scalable TAD models can be built with minimal architectural complexity. We release our code, domain-adapted encoders, and fine-tuned models to support future work: https://github.com/tue-mps/simple-tad.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCVW...</summary><p>ICCVW 2025 accepted.

| **[Toward a Holistic Multi-Criteria Trajectory Evaluation Framework for Autonomous Driving in Mixed Traffic Environment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01291v1)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a unified framework for the evaluation and optimization of autonomous vehicle trajectories, integrating formal safety, comfort, and efficiency criteria. An innovative geometric indicator, based on the analysis of safety zones using adaptive ellipses, is used to accurately quantify collision risks. Our method applies the Shoelace formula to compute the intersection area in the case of misaligned and time-varying configurations. Comfort is modeled using indicators centered on longitudinal and lateral jerk, while efficiency is assessed by overall travel time. These criteria are aggregated into a comprehensive objective function solved using a PSO based algorithm. The approach was successfully validated under real traffic conditions via experiments conducted in an urban intersection involving an autonomous vehicle interacting with a human-operated vehicle, and in simulation using data recorded from human driving in real traffic.</p></details> |  |
| **[Redesigning Traffic Signs to Mitigate Machine-Learning Patch Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04660v3)** | 2025-08-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic-Sign Recognition (TSR) is a critical safety component for autonomous driving. Unfortunately, however, past work has highlighted the vulnerability of TSR models to physical-world attacks, through low-cost, easily deployable adversarial patches leading to misclassification. To mitigate these threats, most defenses focus on altering the training process or modifying the inference procedure. Still, while these approaches improve adversarial robustness, TSR remains susceptible to attacks attaining substantial success rates. To further the adversarial robustness of TSR, this work offers a novel approach that redefines traffic-sign designs to create signs that promote robustness while remaining interpretable to humans. Our framework takes three inputs: (1) A traffic-sign standard along with modifiable features and associated constraints; (2) A state-of-the-art adversarial training method; and (3) A function for efficiently synthesizing realistic traffic-sign images. Using these user-defined inputs, the framework emits an optimized traffic-sign standard such that traffic signs generated per this standard enable training TSR models with increased adversarial robustness. We evaluate the effectiveness of our framework via a concrete implementation, where we allow modifying the pictograms (i.e., symbols) and colors of traffic signs. The results show substantial improvements in robustness -- with gains of up to 16.33%--24.58% in robust accuracy over state-of-the-art methods -- while benign accuracy is even improved. Importantly, a user study also confirms that the redesigned traffic signs remain easily recognizable and to human observers. Overall, the results highlight that carefully redesigning traffic signs can significantly enhance TSR system robustness without compromising human interpretability.</p></details> |  |

We consider a high-dimensional bipartite matching system under uncertainty and seek an effective dynamic control policy that maximizes the expected discounted total value generated by the matches minus the congestion-related costs. To derive a tractable approximation, we focus attention on balanced, high-volume systems, i.e., the heavy-traffic regime, and derive an approximating Brownian control problem. We then develop a computational method that relies on deep neural network technology for solving this problem. To show the effectiveness of the policy derived from our computational method, we compare it to the benchmark policies available in the extant literature in the context of the original matching problem. In the test problems attempted thus far, our proposed policy outperforms the benchmarks, and its derivation is computationally feasible for dimensions up to 100 or more.</p></details> |  |
| **[ReWeave: Traffic Engineering with Robust Path Weaving for Localized Link Failure Recover](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00708v1)** | 2025-08-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Link failures occur frequently in Internet Service Provider (ISP) networks and pose significant challenges for Traffic Engineering (TE). Existing TE schemes either reroute traffic over vulnerable static paths, leading to performance degradation, or precompute backup routes for a broad range of failure scenarios, which introduces high overhead and limits scalability. Hence, an effective failure recovery mechanism is required to offer sufficient path diversity under constrained overhead, thereby ensuring robust and performant network operation. This paper presents ReWeave, a scalable and efficient link-level TE scheme that enables localized rerouting by equipping each link with a compact set of adjacent-only backup paths. Upon detecting a failure, only the routers at both ends of the failed link reroute traffic dynamically using SRv6-based detours, without controller intervention or full-path recomputation. Evaluation results on large-scale backbone networks demonstrate that ReWeave outperforms existing TE schemes in link failure scenarios. Compared to HARP, the state-of-the-art failure recovery scheme based on centralized control and dynamic traffic reallocation, our approach reduces the average maximum link utilization by 10.5%~20.1%, and lowers the worst-case utilization by 29.5%~40.9%. When compared with Flexile, a protection-based scheme that precomputes routes for multi-failure scenarios, ReWeave achieves a similarly low packet loss rate in 90% of failure cases, while maintaining a response speed comparable to the fastest router-based local rerouting schemes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in IEEE ICNP 2025</p></details> |

In this paper,we present X-PRINT,the first server-centric,URI-based framework for cross-platform fine-grained encrypted-traffic fingerprinting.X-PRINT systematically demonstrates that backend URI invocation patterns can serve as platform-agnostic invariants and are effective for mod-eling fine-grained behaviors.To achieve robust identifica-tion,X-PRINT further leverages temporally structured URI maps for behavior inference and emphasizes the exclusion of platform-or application-specific private URIs to handle unseen cases,thereby improving reliability in open-world and cross-platform settings.Extensive experiments across diverse cross-platform and open-world settings show that X-PRINT achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in fine-grained fingerprint-ing and exhibits strong scalability and robustness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unsupervised Dataset Cleaning Framework for Encrypted Traffic Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00701v1)** | 2025-08-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic classification, a technique for assigning network flows to predefined categories, has been widely deployed in enterprise and carrier networks. With the massive adoption of mobile devices, encryption is increasingly used in mobile applications to address privacy concerns. Consequently, traditional methods such as Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) fail to distinguish encrypted traffic. To tackle this challenge, Artificial Intelligence (AI), in particular Machine Learning (ML), has emerged as a promising solution for encrypted traffic classification. A crucial prerequisite for any ML-based approach is traffic data cleaning, which removes flows that are not useful for training (e.g., irrelevant protocols, background activity, control-plane messages, and long-lived sessions). Existing cleaning solutions depend on manual inspection of every captured packet, making the process both costly and time-consuming. In this poster, we present an unsupervised framework that automatically cleans encrypted mobile traffic. Evaluation on real-world datasets shows that our framework incurs only a 2%~2.5% reduction in classification accuracy compared with manual cleaning. These results demonstrate that our method offers an efficient and effective preprocessing step for ML-based encrypted traffic classification.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in IEEE ICNP 2025 Poster</p></details> |

However, in complex UAV perspectives, challenges such as small target scale variations, occlusions, nonlinear crossing motions, and motion blur severely hinder the stability of multi-object tracking. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel multi-object tracking framework, SocialTrack, aimed at enhancing the tracking accuracy and robustness of small targets in complex urban traffic environments. The specialized small-target detector enhances the detection performance by employing a multi-scale feature enhancement mechanism. The Velocity Adaptive Cubature Kalman Filter (VACKF) improves the accuracy of trajectory prediction by incorporating a velocity dynamic modeling mechanism. The Group Motion Compensation Strategy (GMCS) models social group motion priors to provide stable state update references for low-quality tracks, significantly improving the target association accuracy in complex dynamic environments. Furthermore, the Spatio-Temporal Memory Prediction (STMP) leverages historical trajectory information to predict the future state of low-quality tracks, effectively mitigating identity switching issues. Extensive experiments on the UAVDT and MOT17 datasets demonstrate that SocialTrack outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods across several key metrics. Significant improvements in MOTA and IDF1, among other core performance indicators, highlight its superior robustness and adaptability. Additionally, SocialTrack is highly modular and compatible, allowing for seamless integration with existing trackers to further enhance performance.</p></details> |  |

Recent advances in spatial-temporal models have markedly improved the modeling of intricate spatial-temporal correlations for traffic forecasting. Unfortunately, most previous studies have encountered challenges in effectively modeling spatial-temporal correlations across various perceptual perspectives, which have neglected the interactive fusion between traffic patterns and spatial correlations. Additionally, constrained by spatial heterogeneity, most studies fail to consider distinct regional heterogeneity during message-passing. To overcome these limitations, we propose a Pattern-Spatial Interactive and Regional Awareness Graph Convolutional Network (PSIRAGCN) for traffic forecasting. Specifically, we propose a pattern-spatial interactive fusion framework composed of pattern and spatial modules. This framework aims to capture patterns and spatial correlations by adopting a perception perspective from the global to the local level and facilitating mutual utilization with positive feedback. In the spatial module, we designed a graph convolutional network based on message-passing. The network is designed to leverage a regional characteristics bank to reconstruct data-driven message-passing with regional awareness. Reconstructed message passing can reveal the regional heterogeneity between nodes in the traffic network. Extensive experiments on three real-world traffic datasets demonstrate that PSIRAGCN outperforms the State-of-the-art baseline while balancing computational costs.</p></details> |  |

This neglects the significant impact of lateral decisions, such as lane changes, on overall energy efficiency, especially in environments with traffic signals and heterogeneous traffic flow. To address this gap, we propose a novel energy-aware motion planning framework that jointly optimizes longitudinal speed and lateral lane-change decisions using vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication. Our approach estimates long-term energy costs using a graph-based approximation and solves short-horizon optimal control problems under traffic constraints. Using a data-driven energy model calibrated to an actual battery electric vehicle, we demonstrate with vehicle-in-the-loop experiments that our method reduces motion energy consumption by up to 24 percent compared to a human driver, highlighting the potential of connectivity-enabled planning for sustainable urban autonomy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at 2025 IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC25')</p></details> |

Existing traffic prediction models primarily rely on temporal traffic data, with limited efforts incorporating human knowledge and experience for urban traffic demand forecasting. However, in real-world scenarios, traffic knowledge and experience derived from human daily life significantly influence precise traffic prediction. Such knowledge and experiences can guide the model in uncovering latent patterns within traffic data, thereby enhancing the accuracy and robustness of predictions. To this end, this paper proposes integrating structured temporal traffic data with textual data representing human knowledge and experience, resulting in a novel knowledge-guided cross-modal feature representation learning (KGCM) model for traffic demand prediction. Based on regional transportation characteristics, we construct a prior knowledge dataset using a large language model combined with manual authoring and revision, covering both regional and global knowledge and experiences. The KGCM model then learns multimodal data features through designed local and global adaptive graph networks, as well as a cross-modal feature fusion mechanism. A proposed reasoning-based dynamic update strategy enables dynamic optimization of the graph model's parameters, achieving optimal performance. Experiments on multiple traffic datasets demonstrate that our model accurately predicts future traffic demand and outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) models.</p></details> |  |

DFOS detects vehicle driving vibrations along the optical fiber and obtains their trajectories in the spatiotemporal plane. From these trajectories, DFOS provides mean velocities for real-time spatially continuous traffic monitoring without dead zones. However, when vehicle vibration intensities are insufficiently low due to slow speed, trajectories cannot be obtained, leading to missing values in mean velocity data. It restricts DFOS applicability in severe congestion. Therefore, this paper proposes a missing value imputation method based on data assimilation. Our proposed method is validated on two expressways in Japan with the reference data. The results show that the mean absolute error (MAE) of the imputed mean velocities to the reference increases only by 1.5 km/h as compared with the MAE of non-missing values. This study enhances the wide-range applicability of DFOS in practical cases.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 7 figures, presented in the 31st ITS World Congress</p></details> |

Deep learning has advanced video-based traffic monitoring through video question answering (VideoQA) models, enabling structured insight extraction from traffic videos.

The InterAct VideoQA dataset comprises 8 hours of real-world traffic footage collected from diverse intersections, segmented into 10-second video clips, with over 25,000 question-answer (QA) pairs covering spatiotemporal dynamics, vehicle interactions, incident detection, and other critical traffic attributes. State-of-the-art VideoQA models are evaluated on InterAct VideoQA, exposing challenges in reasoning over fine-grained spatiotemporal dependencies within complex traffic scenarios. Additionally, fine-tuning these models on InterAct VideoQA yields notable performance improvements, demonstrating the necessity of domain-specific datasets for VideoQA.

Trajectory control represents a user-friendly task in the field of controllable video generation. However, existing methods either require substantial training resources or are specifically designed for U-Net, do not take advantage of the superior performance of DiT. To address these issues, we propose DiTraj, a simple but effective training-free framework for trajectory control in text-to-video generation, tailored for DiT. Specifically, first, to inject the object's trajectory, we propose foreground-background separation guidance: we use the Large Language Model (LLM) to convert user-provided prompts into foreground and background prompts, which respectively guide the generation of foreground and background regions in the video. Then, we analyze 3D full attention and explore the tight correlation between inter-token attention scores and position embedding. Based on this, we propose inter-frame Spatial-Temporal Decoupled 3D-RoPE (STD-RoPE). By modifying only foreground tokens' position embedding, STD-RoPE eliminates their cross-frame spatial discrepancies, strengthening cross-frame attention among them and thus enhancing trajectory control. Additionally, we achieve 3D-aware trajectory control by regulating the density of position embedding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms previous methods in both video quality and trajectory controllability.</p></details> |  |
| **[VQToken: Neural Discrete Token Representation Learning for Extreme Token Reduction in Video Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16980v6)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Token-based video representation has emerged as a promising approach for enabling large language models (LLMs) to interpret video content. However, existing token reduction techniques, such as pruning and merging, often disrupt essential positional embeddings and rely on continuous visual tokens sampled from nearby pixels with similar spatial-temporal locations. By removing only a small fraction of tokens, these methods still produce relatively lengthy continuous sequences, which falls short of the extreme compression required to balance computational efficiency and token count in video LLMs. In this paper, we introduce the novel task of Extreme Short Token Reduction, which aims to represent entire videos using a minimal set of discrete tokens. We propose VQToken, a neural discrete token representation framework that (i) applies adaptive vector quantization to continuous ViT embeddings to learn a compact codebook and (ii) preserves spatial-temporal positions via a token hash function by assigning each grid-level token to its nearest codebook entry. On the Extreme Short Token Reduction task, our VQToken compresses sequences to just 0.07 percent of their original length while incurring only a 0.66 percent drop in accuracy on the NextQA-MC benchmark. It also achieves comparable performance on ActNet-QA, Long Video Bench, and VideoMME. We further introduce the Token Information Density (TokDense) metric and formalize fixed-length and adaptive-length subtasks, achieving state-of-the-art results in both settings.

In this study, we present an automated sleep stage classifier called the Attentive Dilated Convolutional Neural Network (AttDiCNN), which uses deep learning methodologies to address challenges related to data heterogeneity, computational complexity, and reliable and automatic sleep staging. We employed a force-directed layout based on the visibility graph to capture the most significant information from the EEG signals, thereby representing the spatial-temporal features. The proposed network consists of three modules: the Localized Spatial Feature Extraction Network (LSFE), Spatio-Temporal-Temporal Long Retention Network (S2TLR), and Global Averaging Attention Network (G2A). The LSFE captures spatial information from sleep data, the S2TLR is designed to extract the most pertinent information in long-term contexts, and the G2A reduces computational overhead by aggregating information from the LSFE and S2TLR. We evaluated the performance of our model on three comprehensive and publicly accessible datasets, achieving state-of-the-art accuracies of 98.56%, 99.66%, and 99.08% for the EDFX, HMC, and NCH datasets, respectively, while maintaining a low computational complexity with 1.4 M parameters. Our proposed architecture surpasses existing methodologies in several performance metrics, thereby proving its potential as an automated tool for clinical settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>19-pa...</summary><p>19-pages main paper and 3-pages supplementary material</p></details> |
| **[Multi-Scale Spatial-Temporal Hypergraph Network with Lead-Lag Structures for Stock Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23668v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting occurs in a range of financial applications providing essential decision-making support to investors, regulatory institutions, and analysts. Unlike multivariate time series from other domains, stock time series exhibit industry correlation. Exploiting this kind of correlation can improve forecasting accuracy. However, existing methods based on hypergraphs can only capture industry correlation relatively superficially. These methods face two key limitations: they do not fully consider inter-industry lead-lag interactions, and they do not model multi-scale information within and among industries. This study proposes the Hermes framework for stock time series forecasting that aims to improve the exploitation of industry correlation by eliminating these limitations. The framework integrates moving aggregation and multi-scale fusion modules in a hypergraph network. Specifically, to more flexibly capture the lead-lag relationships among industries, Hermes proposes a hyperedge-based moving aggregation module. This module incorporates a sliding window and utilizes dynamic temporal aggregation operations to consider lead-lag dependencies among industries. Additionally, to effectively model multi-scale information, Hermes employs cross-scale, edge-to-edge message passing to integrate information from different scales while maintaining the consistency of each scale. Experimental results on multiple real-world stock datasets show that Hermes outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in both efficiency and accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[UniPose: Unified Cross-modality Pose Prior Propagation towards RGB-D data for Weakly Supervised 3D Human Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23376v1)** | 2025-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we present UniPose, a unified cross-modality pose prior propagation method for weakly supervised 3D human pose estimation (HPE) using unannotated single-view RGB-D sequences (RGB, depth, and point cloud data). UniPose transfers 2D HPE annotations from large-scale RGB datasets (e.g., MS COCO) to the 3D domain via self-supervised learning on easily acquired RGB-D sequences, eliminating the need for labor-intensive 3D keypoint annotations. This approach bridges the gap between 2D and 3D domains without suffering from issues related to multi-view camera calibration or synthetic-to-real data shifts. During training, UniPose leverages off-the-shelf 2D pose estimations as weak supervision for point cloud networks, incorporating spatial-temporal constraints like body symmetry and joint motion. The 2D-to-3D back-projection loss and cross-modality interaction further enhance this process. By treating the point cloud network's 3D HPE results as pseudo ground truth, our anchor-to-joint prediction method performs 3D lifting on RGB and depth networks, making it more robust against inaccuracies in 2D HPE results compared to state-of-the-art methods. Experiments on CMU Panoptic and ITOP datasets show that UniPose achieves comparable performance to fully supervised methods. Incorporating large-scale unlabeled data (e.g., NTU RGB+D 60) enhances its performance under challenging conditions, demonstrating its potential for practical applications. Our proposed 3D lifting method also achieves state-of-the-art results.</p></details> | Accept at PRCV 2025 |

Existing solutions, such as model fine-tuning and warping-based repainting, struggle with scalability, generalization, and robustness against artifacts. To address this, we propose WorldForge, a training-free, inference-time framework composed of three tightly coupled modules. 1) Intra-Step Recursive Refinement injects fine-grained trajectory guidance at denoising steps through a recursive correction loop, ensuring motion remains aligned with the target path. 2) Flow-Gated Latent Fusion leverages optical flow similarity to decouple motion from appearance in the latent space and selectively inject trajectory guidance into motion-related channels. 3) Dual-Path Self-Corrective Guidance compares guided and unguided denoising paths to adaptively correct trajectory drift caused by noisy or misaligned structural signals. Together, these components inject fine-grained, trajectory-aligned guidance without training, achieving both accurate motion control and photorealistic content generation. Our framework is plug-and-play and model-agnostic, enabling broad applicability across various 3D/4D tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in trajectory adherence, geometric consistency, and perceptual quality, outperforming both training-intensive and inference-only baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Webpage: https://worldforge-agi.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[Boosting LLM Serving through Spatial-Temporal GPU Resource Sharing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19516v4)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern LLM serving systems confront inefficient GPU utilization due to the fundamental mismatch between compute-intensive prefill and memory-bound decode phases. While current practices attempt to address this by organizing these phases into hybrid batches, such solutions create an inefficient tradeoff that sacrifices either throughput or latency, leaving substantial GPU resources underutilized. We identify two key root causes: 1) the prefill phase suffers from suboptimal compute utilization due to wave quantization and attention bottlenecks. 2) hybrid batches disproportionately prioritize latency over throughput, resulting in wasted compute and memory bandwidth. To mitigate the issues, we present Bullet, a novel spatial-temporal orchestration system that eliminates these inefficiencies through precise phase coordination. Bullet enables concurrent execution of prefill and decode phases, while dynamically provisioning GPU resources using real-time performance modeling. By integrating SLO-aware scheduling and adaptive resource allocation, Bullet maximizes utilization without compromising latency targets. Experimental evaluations on real-world workloads demonstrate that Bullet delivers 1.26x average throughput gains (up to 1.55x) over state-of-the-arts, while consistently meeting latency constraints.</p></details> |  |
| **[STQE: Spatial-Temporal Attribute Quality Enhancement for G-PCC Compressed Dynamic Point Clouds](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17522v2)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Very few studies have addressed quality enhancement for compressed dynamic point clouds. In particular, the effective exploitation of spatial-temporal correlations between point cloud frames remains largely unexplored. Addressing this gap, we propose a spatial-temporal attribute quality enhancement (STQE) network that exploits both spatial and temporal correlations to improve the visual quality of G-PCC compressed dynamic point clouds. Our contributions include a recoloring-based motion compensation module that remaps reference attribute information to the current frame geometry to achieve precise inter-frame geometric alignment, a channel-aware temporal attention module that dynamically highlights relevant regions across bidirectional reference frames, a Gaussian-guided neighborhood feature aggregation module that efficiently captures spatial dependencies between geometry and color attributes, and a joint loss function based on the Pearson correlation coefficient, designed to alleviate over-smoothing effects typical of point-wise mean squared error optimization. When applied to the latest G-PCC test model, STQE achieved improvements of 0.855 dB, 0.682 dB, and 0.828 dB in delta PSNR, with Bj{\o}ntegaard Delta rate (BD-rate) reductions of -25.2%, -31.6%, and -32.5% for the Luma, Cb, and Cr components, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[VideoPASTA: 7K Preference Pairs That Matter for Video-LLM Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14096v3)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video-language models (Video-LLMs) excel at understanding video content but struggle with spatial relationships, temporal ordering, and cross-frame continuity. To address these limitations, we introduce VideoPASTA (Preference Alignment with Spatio-Temporal-Cross Frame Adversaries), a framework that enhances Video-LLMs through targeted preference optimization. VideoPASTA trains models to distinguish accurate video representations from carefully crafted adversarial examples that deliberately violate spatial, temporal, or cross-frame relationships. With only 7,020 preference pairs and Direct Preference Optimization, VideoPASTA enables models to learn robust representations that capture fine-grained spatial details and long-range temporal dynamics. Experiments demonstrate that VideoPASTA is model agnostic and significantly improves performance, for example, achieving gains of up to +3.8 percentage points on LongVideoBench, +4.1 on VideoMME, and +4.0 on MVBench, when applied to various state-of-the-art Video-LLMs. These results demonstrate that targeted alignment, rather than massive pretraining or architectural modifications, effectively addresses core video-language challenges. Notably, VideoPASTA achieves these improvements without any human annotation or captioning, relying solely on 32-frame sampling. This efficiency makes our approach a scalable plug-and-play solution that seamlessly integrates with existing models while preserving their original capabilities.</p></details> | EMNLP 2025 (Main) |

Thus, the security of ATT is highly critical for real-world applications. Under the scope, we present a new type of attack: distance-pulling attacks (DPA) and a systematic study of it, which exploits vulnerabilities in ATT systems to dangerously reduce tracking distances, leading to drone capturing, increased susceptibility to sensor attacks, or even physical collisions. To achieve these goals, we present FlyTrap, a novel physical-world attack framework that employs an adversarial umbrella as a deployable and domain-specific attack vector. FlyTrap is specifically designed to meet key desired objectives in attacking ATT drones: physical deployability, closed-loop effectiveness, and spatial-temporal consistency. Through novel progressive distance-pulling strategy and controllable spatial-temporal consistency designs, FlyTrap manipulates ATT drones in real-world setups to achieve significant system-level impacts. Our evaluations include new datasets, metrics, and closed-loop experiments on real-world white-box and even commercial ATT drones, including DJI and HoverAir. Results demonstrate FlyTrap's ability to reduce tracking distances within the range to be captured, sensor attacked, or even directly crashed, highlighting urgent security risks and practical implications for the safe deployment of ATT systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>An ex...</summary><p>An extended version of the paper accepted by NDSS 2026</p></details> |

However, the development of truly general 4D world models remains fundamentally constrained by the availability of high-quality data. Existing datasets and benchmarks often lack the dynamic complexity, multi-domain diversity, and spatial-temporal annotations required to support key tasks such as 4D geometric reconstruction, future prediction, and camera-control video generation. To address this gap, we introduce OmniWorld, a large-scale, multi-domain, multi-modal dataset specifically designed for 4D world modeling. OmniWorld consists of a newly collected OmniWorld-Game dataset and several curated public datasets spanning diverse domains. Compared with existing synthetic datasets, OmniWorld-Game provides richer modality coverage, larger scale, and more realistic dynamic interactions. Based on this dataset, we establish a challenging benchmark that exposes the limitations of current state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches in modeling complex 4D environments. Moreover, fine-tuning existing SOTA methods on OmniWorld leads to significant performance gains across 4D reconstruction and video generation tasks, strongly validating OmniWorld as a powerful resource for training and evaluation. We envision OmniWorld as a catalyst for accelerating the development of general-purpose 4D world models, ultimately advancing machines' holistic understanding of the physical world.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://yangzhou24.github.io/OmniWorld/</p></details> |

Unlike existing 3DGS inpainting methods that perform generative completion relying on 2D perspective-view-based diffusion or GAN models to predict limited appearance or depth cues for missing regions, our approach enables substitutional scene inpainting and editing directly through the 3DGS modality, extricating it from requiring spatial-temporal consistency of 2D cross-modals and eliminating the need for time-intensive retraining of Gaussians. Our key insight is that the highly repetitive patterns in driving scenes often share multi-modal similarities within the implicit 3DGS feature space and are particularly suitable for structural matching to enable effective 3DGS-based substitutional inpainting. Practically, we construct feature-embedded 3DGS scenes to incorporate a patch measurement method for abstracting local context at different scales and, subsequently, propose a structural search method to find candidate patches in 3D space effectively. Finally, we propose a simple yet effective substitution-and-fusion optimization for better visual harmony. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple publicly available datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed method in driving scenes, and the results validate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to the baseline methods in terms of both quality and interoperability. Additional experiments in general scenes also demonstrate the applicability of the proposed 3D inpainting strategy.

| **[On the Integration of Spatial-Temporal Knowledge: A Lightweight Approach to Atmospheric Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09695v2)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformers have gained attention in atmospheric time series forecasting (ATSF) for their ability to capture global spatial-temporal correlations. However, their complex architectures lead to excessive parameter counts and extended training times, limiting their scalability to large-scale forecasting. In this paper, we revisit ATSF from a theoretical perspective of atmospheric dynamics and uncover a key insight: spatial-temporal position embedding (STPE) can inherently model spatial-temporal correlations even without attention mechanisms. Its effectiveness arises from the integration of geographical coordinates and temporal features, which are intrinsically linked to atmospheric dynamics. Based on this, we propose STELLA, a Spatial-Temporal knowledge Embedded Lightweight modeL for ASTF, utilizing only STPE and an MLP architecture in place of Transformer layers. With 10k parameters and one hour of training, STELLA achieves superior performance on five datasets compared to other advanced methods. The paper emphasizes the effectiveness of spatial-temporal knowledge integration over complex architectures, providing novel insights for ATSF.

Conventional 4D reconstruction methods, which typically rely on phase binning or separate template scans, struggle to capture temporal variability, complicate workflows, and impose heavy computational loads. We introduce a neural representation framework that considers respiratory motion as a smooth, continuous deformation steered by a 1D surrogate signal, completely replacing the conventional discrete sorting approach. The new method fuses motion modeling with image reconstruction through two synergistic networks: the Spatial Anatomy Network (SAN) encodes a continuous 3D anatomical representation, while a Temporal Motion Network (TMN), guided by Transformer-derived respiratory signals, produces temporally consistent deformation fields. Evaluation using a free-breathing dataset of 19 volunteers demonstrates that our template- and phase-free method accurately captures both regular and irregular respiratory patterns, while preserving vessel and bronchial continuity with high anatomical fidelity. The proposed method significantly improves efficiency, reducing the total processing time from approximately five hours required by conventional discrete sorting methods to just 15 minutes of training. Furthermore, it enables inference of each 3D volume in under one second. The framework accurately reconstructs 3D images at any respiratory state, achieves superior performance compared to conventional methods, and demonstrates strong potential for application in 4D radiation therapy planning and real-time adaptive treatment.</p></details> |  |

However, their large model size and the quadratic cost of spatial-temporal attention over multiple denoising steps make video generation computationally expensive. Static caching mitigates this by reusing features across fixed steps but fails to adapt to generation dynamics, leading to suboptimal trade-offs between speed and quality. We propose Foresight, an adaptive layer-reuse technique that reduces computational redundancy across denoising steps while preserving baseline performance. Foresight dynamically identifies and reuses DiT block outputs for all layers across steps, adapting to generation parameters such as resolution and denoising schedules to optimize efficiency.

We propose MSGAT-GRU, a multi-scale graph attention and recurrent model that jointly captures localized and long-range spatial dependencies while modeling sequential dynamics. Heterogeneous inputs, such as traffic flow, road attributes, weather, and points of interest, are systematically fused to enhance robustness and interpretability. On the Hybrid Beijing Accidents dataset, MSGAT-GRU achieves an RMSE of 0.334 and an F1-score of 0.878, consistently outperforming strong baselines. Cross-dataset evaluation on METR-LA under a 1-hour horizon further supports transferability, with RMSE of 6.48 (vs. 7.21 for the GMAN model) and comparable MAPE. Ablations indicate that three-hop spatial aggregation and a two-layer GRU offer the best accuracy-stability trade-off. These results position MSGAT-GRU as a scalable and generalizable model for intelligent transportation systems, providing interpretable signals that can inform proactive traffic management and road safety analytics.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 4 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

While early methods relied on 3D morphable models or feature warping techniques, they often suffered from limited expressivity, temporal inconsistency, and poor generalization to unseen identities or large pose variations. Recent advances using diffusion models have demonstrated improved quality but remain constrained by weak control signals and architectural limitations. In this work, we propose a novel diffusion based framework that leverages masked facial regions specifically the eyes, nose, and mouth from the driving video as strong motion control cues. To enable robust training without appearance leakage, we adopt cross identity supervision. To leverage the strong prior from the pretrained diffusion model, our novel architecture introduces minimal new parameters that converge faster and help in better generalization. We introduce spatial temporal attention mechanisms that allow inter frame and intra frame interactions, effectively capturing subtle motions and reducing temporal artifacts. Our model uses history frames to ensure continuity across segments. At inference, we propose a novel signal fusion strategy that balances motion fidelity with identity preservation. Our approach achieves superior temporal consistency and accurate expression control, enabling high-quality, controllable portrait animation suitable for real-world applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://stable-video-driven-portraits.github.io/</p></details> |

Based on a long time-series perspective, this paper explores uncertainties in the realms of renewable power and deep learning. Then, an uncertainty-aware model is meticulously designed for renewable scenario forecasting, which leverages an attention mechanism and generative adversarial networks (GANs) to precisely capture complex spatial-temporal dynamics. To improve the interpretability of uncertain behavior in RES generation, Bayesian deep learning and adaptive instance normalization (AdaIN) are incorporated to simulate typical patterns and variations. Additionally, the integration of meteorological information, forecasts, and historical trajectories in the processing layer improves the synergistic forecasting capability for multiscale periodic regularities. Numerical experiments and case analyses demonstrate that the proposed approach provides an appropriate interpretation for renewable uncertainty representation, including both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties, and shows superior performance over state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

To address limitations of existing methods, such as insufficient use of multiscale features and low efficiency in differential feature fusion, this paper proposes a cross-hierarchical multi-feature fusion network (CHMFFN) based on a multiscale encoder-decoder architecture. The front-end adopts a multiscale feature extraction subnetwork, built on an encoder-decoder backbone with residual connections and a dual-core channel-spatial attention (DCCSA) module to extract spectral-spatial-temporal features (SSTF). The encoder captures multiscale features from shallow details to deep semantics via residual blocks and convolutional kernels with varying receptive fields. The decoder restores spatial resolution and suppresses noise information through skip connections integrating encoder features. Additionally, a spectral-temporal change feature learning (STCFL) module learns cross-temporal change features at different levels, strengthening inter-temporal difference capture. An adaptive fusion of advanced features (AFAF) module dynamically balances hierarchical differential features via adaptive weights, enhancing representation of complex changes. Experiments on four public hyperspectral datasets show CHMFFN outperforms state-of-the-art methods, verifying its effectiveness.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

Recent advances have explored utilizing 3D semantic Gaussians to model occupancy while reducing computational overhead, but they remain constrained by insufficient multi-view spatial interaction and limited multi-frame temporal consistency.

Specifically, we develop a guidance-informed spatial aggregation strategy within a dual-mode attention mechanism to strengthen spatial interaction in Gaussian representations. Furthermore, we introduce a geometry-aware temporal fusion scheme that effectively leverages historical context to improve temporal continuity in scene completion. Extensive experiments on the large-scale nuScenes occupancy prediction benchmark showcase that our proposed approach not only achieves state-of-the-art performance but also delivers markedly better temporal consistency compared to existing Gaussian-based methods.</p></details> |  |

Existing solutions using wearable sensors, ambient sensors, and RGB-based vision systems face challenges in reliability, user compliance, and practicality. Studies indicate that stakeholders, such as older adults and eldercare facilities, prefer non-wearable, passive, privacy-preserving, and real-time fall detection systems that require no user interaction. This study proposes an advanced thermal fall detection method using a Bidirectional Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (BiConvLSTM) model, enhanced with spatial, temporal, feature, self, and general attention mechanisms. Through systematic experimentation across hundreds of model variations exploring the integration of attention mechanisms, recurrent modules, and motion flow, we identified top-performing architectures. Among them, BiConvLSTM achieved state-of-the-art performance with a ROC-AUC of $99.7\%$ on the TSF dataset and demonstrated robust results on TF-66, a newly emerged, diverse, and privacy-preserving benchmark. These results highlight the generalizability and practicality of the proposed model, setting new standards for thermal fall detection and paving the way toward deployable, high-performance solutions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Emulating Human-like Adaptive Vision for Efficient and Flexible Machine Visual Perception](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15333v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human vision is highly adaptive, efficiently sampling intricate environments by sequentially fixating on task-relevant regions. In contrast, prevailing machine vision models passively process entire scenes at once, resulting in excessive resource demands scaling with spatial-temporal input resolution and model size, yielding critical limitations impeding both future advancements and real-world application. Here we introduce AdaptiveNN, a general framework aiming to drive a paradigm shift from 'passive' to 'active, adaptive' vision models. AdaptiveNN formulates visual perception as a coarse-to-fine sequential decision-making process, progressively identifying and attending to regions pertinent to the task, incrementally combining information across fixations, and actively concluding observation when sufficient. We establish a theory integrating representation learning with self-rewarding reinforcement learning, enabling end-to-end training of the non-differentiable AdaptiveNN without additional supervision on fixation locations. We assess AdaptiveNN on 17 benchmarks spanning 9 tasks, including large-scale visual recognition, fine-grained discrimination, visual search, processing images from real driving and medical scenarios, language-driven embodied AI, and side-by-side comparisons with humans. AdaptiveNN achieves up to 28x inference cost reduction without sacrificing accuracy, flexibly adapts to varying task demands and resource budgets without retraining, and provides enhanced interpretability via its fixation patterns, demonstrating a promising avenue toward efficient, flexible, and interpretable computer vision. Furthermore, AdaptiveNN exhibits closely human-like perceptual behaviors in many cases, revealing its potential as a valuable tool for investigating visual cognition.

However, current end-to-end frameworks suffer a critical spatial-temporal trade-off: optimizing for spatially coherent layouts of key elements (e.g., character identity preservation) often compromises instruction-compliant temporal smoothness, while prioritizing dynamic realism risks disrupting the spatial coherence of visual structures. To tackle this issue, we propose a simple yet effective spatial-temporal decoupled framework that decomposes representations into spatial features for layouts and temporal features for motion dynamics. Specifically, our paper proposes a semantic prompt optimization mechanism and stage-wise decoupled generation paradigm. The former module decouples the prompt into spatial and temporal components. Aligned with the subsequent stage-wise decoupled approach, the spatial prompts guide the text-to-image (T2I) stage to generate coherent spatial features, while the temporal prompts direct the sequential image-to-video (I2V) stage to ensure motion consistency. Experimental results validate that our approach achieves excellent spatiotemporal consistency, demonstrating outstanding performance in identity preservation, text relevance, and video quality. By leveraging this simple yet robust mechanism, our algorithm secures the runner-up position in 2025 ACM MultiMedia Challenge.</p></details> |  |

We present a time-distributed hybrid U-Net autoencoder that integrates a Bi-directional Temporal Graph Attention Transformer (B-TGAT) to guide efficient temporal clustering of multidimensional spatiotemporal climate datasets. The encoder and decoder are equipped with ConvLSTM2D modules that extract joint spatial--temporal features by modeling localized dynamics and spatial correlations over time, and skip connections that preserve multiscale spatial details during feature compression and reconstruction. At the bottleneck, B-TGAT integrates graph-based spatial modeling with attention-driven temporal encoding, enabling adaptive weighting of temporal neighbors and capturing both short and long-range dependencies across regions. This architecture produces discriminative latent embeddings optimized for clustering. Experiments on three distinct spatiotemporal climate datasets demonstrate superior cluster separability, temporal stability, and alignment with known climate transitions compared to state-of-the-art baselines. The integration of ConvLSTM2D, U-Net skip connections, and B-TGAT enhances temporal clustering performance while providing interpretable insights into complex spatiotemporal variability, advancing both methodological development and climate science applications.</p></details> | 10 pages, In review |
| **[An Uncertainty-Weighted Decision Transformer for Navigation in Dense, Complex Driving Scenarios](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13132v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous driving in dense, dynamic environments requires decision-making systems that can exploit both spatial structure and long-horizon temporal dependencies while remaining robust to uncertainty. This work presents a novel framework that integrates multi-channel bird's-eye-view occupancy grids with transformer-based sequence modeling for tactical driving in complex roundabout scenarios. To address the imbalance between frequent low-risk states and rare safety-critical decisions, we propose the Uncertainty-Weighted Decision Transformer (UWDT). UWDT employs a frozen teacher transformer to estimate per-token predictive entropy, which is then used as a weight in the student model's loss function. This mechanism amplifies learning from uncertain, high-impact states while maintaining stability across common low-risk transitions. Experiments in a roundabout simulator, across varying traffic densities, show that UWDT consistently outperforms other baselines in terms of reward, collision rate, and behavioral stability. The results demonstrate that uncertainty-aware, spatial-temporal transformers can deliver safer and more efficient decision-making for autonomous driving in complex traffic environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unleashing the Power of Discrete-Time State Representation: Ultrafast Target-based IMU-Camera Spatial-Temporal Calibration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12846v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual-inertial fusion is crucial for a large amount of intelligent and autonomous applications, such as robot navigation and augmented reality. To bootstrap and achieve optimal state estimation, the spatial-temporal displacements between IMU and cameras must be calibrated in advance. Most existing calibration methods adopt continuous-time state representation, more specifically the B-spline. Despite these methods achieve precise spatial-temporal calibration, they suffer from high computational cost caused by continuous-time state representation. To this end, we propose a novel and extremely efficient calibration method that unleashes the power of discrete-time state representation. Moreover, the weakness of discrete-time state representation in temporal calibration is tackled in this paper. With the increasing production of drones, cellphones and other visual-inertial platforms, if one million devices need calibration around the world, saving one minute for the calibration of each device means saving 2083 work days in total. To benefit both the research and industry communities, our code will be open-source.</p></details> |  |
| **[CECT-Mamba: a Hierarchical Contrast-enhanced-aware Model for Pancreatic Tumor Subtyping from Multi-phase CECT](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12777v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) is the primary imaging technique that provides valuable spatial-temporal information about lesions, enabling the accurate diagnosis and subclassification of pancreatic tumors. However, the high heterogeneity and variability of pancreatic tumors still pose substantial challenges for precise subtyping diagnosis. Previous methods fail to effectively explore the contextual information across multiple CECT phases commonly used in radiologists' diagnostic workflows, thereby limiting their performance. In this paper, we introduce, for the first time, an automatic way to combine the multi-phase CECT data to discriminate between pancreatic tumor subtypes, among which the key is using Mamba with promising learnability and simplicity to encourage both temporal and spatial modeling from multi-phase CECT. Specifically, we propose a dual hierarchical contrast-enhanced-aware Mamba module incorporating two novel spatial and temporal sampling sequences to explore intra and inter-phase contrast variations of lesions. A similarity-guided refinement module is also imposed into the temporal scanning modeling to emphasize the learning on local tumor regions with more obvious temporal variations. Moreover, we design the space complementary integrator and multi-granularity fusion module to encode and aggregate the semantics across different scales, achieving more efficient learning for subtyping pancreatic tumors. The experimental results on an in-house dataset of 270 clinical cases achieve an accuracy of 97.4% and an AUC of 98.6% in distinguishing between pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PNETs), demonstrating its potential as a more accurate and efficient tool.</p></details> |  |

However, these models continue to suffer from hallucinations, producing content that conflicts with input videos. To address this issue, we propose Dr.V, a hierarchical framework covering perceptive, temporal, and cognitive levels to diagnose video hallucination by fine-grained spatial-temporal grounding. Dr.V comprises of two key components: a benchmark dataset Dr.V-Bench and a satellite video agent Dr.V-Agent. Dr.V-Bench includes 10k instances drawn from 4,974 videos spanning diverse tasks, each enriched with detailed spatial-temporal annotation. Dr.V-Agent detects hallucinations in LVMs by systematically applying fine-grained spatial-temporal grounding at the perceptive and temporal levels, followed by cognitive level reasoning. This step-by-step pipeline mirrors human-like video comprehension and effectively identifies hallucinations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Dr.V-Agent is effective in diagnosing hallucination while enhancing interpretability and reliability, offering a practical blueprint for robust video understanding in real-world scenarios. All our data and code are available at https://github.com/Eurekaleo/Dr.V.</p></details> | 25 pages, 16 figures |
| **[Bridging Vision Language Models and Symbolic Grounding for Video Question Answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11862v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Question Answering (VQA) requires models to reason over spatial, temporal, and causal cues in videos. Recent vision language models (VLMs) achieve strong results but often rely on shallow correlations, leading to weak temporal grounding and limited interpretability. We study symbolic scene graphs (SGs) as intermediate grounding signals for VQA. SGs provide structured object-relation representations that complement VLMs holistic reasoning. We introduce SG-VLM, a modular framework that integrates frozen VLMs with scene graph grounding via prompting and visual localization. Across three benchmarks (NExT-QA, iVQA, ActivityNet-QA) and multiple VLMs (QwenVL, InternVL), SG-VLM improves causal and temporal reasoning and outperforms prior baselines, though gains over strong VLMs are limited. These findings highlight both the promise and current limitations of symbolic grounding, and offer guidance for future hybrid VLM-symbolic approaches in video understanding.</p></details> |  |
| **[Representation-Centric Survey of Skeletal Action Recognition and the ANUBIS Benchmark](http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.02071v6)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D skeleton-based human action recognition has emerged as a powerful alternative to traditional RGB and depth-based approaches, offering robustness to environmental variations, computational efficiency, and enhanced privacy. Despite remarkable progress, current research remains fragmented across diverse input representations and lacks evaluation under scenarios that reflect modern real-world challenges. This paper presents a representation-centric survey of skeleton-based action recognition, systematically categorizing state-of-the-art methods by their input feature types: joint coordinates, bone vectors, motion flows, and extended representations, and analyzing how these choices influence spatial-temporal modeling strategies. Building on the insights from this review, we introduce ANUBIS, a large-scale, challenging skeleton action dataset designed to address critical gaps in existing benchmarks. ANUBIS incorporates multi-view recordings with back-view perspectives, complex multi-person interactions, fine-grained and violent actions, and contemporary social behaviors. We benchmark a diverse set of state-of-the-art models on ANUBIS and conduct an in-depth analysis of how different feature types affect recognition performance across 102 action categories. Our results show strong action-feature dependencies, highlight the limitations of na\"ive multi-representational fusion, and point toward the need for task-aware, semantically aligned integration strategies. This work offers both a comprehensive foundation and a practical benchmarking resource, aiming to guide the next generation of robust, generalizable skeleton-based action recognition systems for complex real-world scenarios.

| **[Tracailer: An Efficient Trajectory Planner for Tractor-Trailer Robots in Unstructured Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19832v2)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The tractor-trailer robot consists of a drivable tractor and one or more non-drivable trailers connected via hitches. Compared to typical car-like robots, the addition of trailers provides greater transportation capability. However, this also complicates motion planning due to the robot's complex kinematics, high-dimensional state space, and deformable structure. To efficiently plan safe, time-optimal trajectories that adhere to the kinematic constraints of the robot and address the challenges posed by its unique features, this paper introduces a lightweight, compact, and high-order smooth trajectory representation for tractor-trailer robots. Based on it, we design an efficiently solvable spatial-temporal trajectory optimization problem. To deal with deformable structures, which leads to difficulties in collision avoidance, we fully leverage the collisionfree regions of the environment, directly applying deformations to trajectories in continuous space. This approach not requires constructing safe regions from the environment using convex approximations through collision-free seed points before each optimization, avoiding the loss of the solution space, thus reducing the dependency of the optimization on initial values. Moreover, a multi-terminal fast path search algorithm is proposed to generate the initial values for optimization. Extensive simulation experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves severalfold improvements in efficiency compared to existing algorithms, while also ensuring lower curvature and trajectory duration. Real-world experiments involving the transportation, loading and unloading of goods in both indoor and outdoor scenarios further validate the effectiveness of our method.

Here, we present a kidney organoid platform optimized for efficient screening in polycystic kidney disease (PKD). While these systems generate rich spatial-temporal microscopy video datasets, current manual approaches to analysis remain limited to coarse classifications (e.g., hit vs. non-hit), often missing valuable pixel-level and longitudinal information. To help overcome this bottleneck, we developed Organoid Tracker, a graphical user interface (GUI) platform designed with a modular plugin architecture, which empowers researchers to extract detailed, quantitative metrics without programming expertise. Built on the cutting-edge vision foundation model Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2), Organoid Tracker enables zero-shot segmentation and automated analysis of spatial-temporal microscopy videos. It quantifies key metrics such as cyst formation rate, growth velocity, and morphological changes, while generating comprehensive reports. By providing an extensible, open-source framework, Organoid Tracker offers a powerful solution for improving and accelerating research in kidney development, PKD modeling, and therapeutic discovery. The platform is publicly available as open-source software at https://github.com/hrlblab/OrganoidTracker.</p></details> |  |

Yet, their integration with natural language understanding has received little attention, leaving a gap in multimodal perception. To address this, we introduce Talk2Event, the first large-scale benchmark for language-driven object grounding using event data. Built on real-world driving scenarios, Talk2Event comprises 5,567 scenes, 13,458 annotated objects, and more than 30,000 carefully validated referring expressions. Each expression is enriched with four structured attributes -- appearance, status, relation to the viewer, and relation to surrounding objects -- that explicitly capture spatial, temporal, and relational cues. This attribute-centric design supports interpretable and compositional grounding, enabling analysis that moves beyond simple object recognition to contextual reasoning in dynamic environments. We envision Talk2Event as a foundation for advancing multimodal and temporally-aware perception, with applications spanning robotics, human-AI interaction, and so on.</p></details> | <details><summary>Abstr...</summary><p>Abstract Paper (Non-Archival) @ ICCV 2025 NeVi Workshop</p></details> |
| **[Crack Path Prediction with Operator Learning using Discrete Particle System data Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01976v2)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately modeling crack propagation is critical for predicting failure in engineering materials and structures, where small cracks can rapidly evolve and cause catastrophic damage. The interaction of cracks with discontinuities, such as holes, significantly affects crack deflection and arrest. Recent developments in discrete particle systems with multibody interactions based on constitutive behavior have demonstrated the ability to capture crack nucleation and evolution without relying on continuum assumptions. In this work, we use data from Constitutively Informed Particle Dynamics (CPD) simulations to train operator learning models, specifically Deep Operator Networks (DeepONets), which learn mappings between function spaces instead of finite-dimensional vectors. We explore two DeepONet variants: vanilla and Fusion DeepONet, for predicting time-evolving crack propagation in specimens with varying geometries. Three representative cases are studied: (i) varying notch height without active fracture; and (ii) and (iii) combinations of notch height and hole radius where dynamic fracture occurs on irregular discrete meshes. The models are trained using geometric inputs in the branch network and spatial-temporal coordinates in the trunk network. Results show that Fusion DeepONet consistently outperforms the vanilla variant, with more accurate predictions especially in non-fracturing cases. Fracture-driven scenarios involving displacement and crack evolution remain more challenging. These findings highlight the potential of Fusion DeepONet to generalize across complex, geometry-varying, and time-dependent crack propagation phenomena.</p></details> | 22 pages, 14 figures |

Recent Vision-Language Models (VLMs) exhibit promising capabilities such as object recognition, common-sense reasoning, and contextual understanding-capabilities that align with the nuanced requirements of social robot navigation. However, it remains unclear whether VLMs can accurately understand complex social navigation scenes (e.g., inferring the spatial-temporal relations among agents and human intentions), which is essential for safe and socially compliant robot navigation. While some recent works have explored the use of VLMs in social robot navigation, no existing work systematically evaluates their ability to meet these necessary conditions. In this paper, we introduce the Social Navigation Scene Understanding Benchmark (SocialNav-SUB), a Visual Question Answering (VQA) dataset and benchmark designed to evaluate VLMs for scene understanding in real-world social robot navigation scenarios. SocialNav-SUB provides a unified framework for evaluating VLMs against human and rule-based baselines across VQA tasks requiring spatial, spatiotemporal, and social reasoning in social robot navigation. Through experiments with state-of-the-art VLMs, we find that while the best-performing VLM achieves an encouraging probability of agreeing with human answers, it still underperforms simpler rule-based approach and human consensus baselines, indicating critical gaps in social scene understanding of current VLMs. Our benchmark sets the stage for further research on foundation models for social robot navigation, offering a framework to explore how VLMs can be tailored to meet real-world social robot navigation needs.

| **[GTS_Forecaster: a novel deep learning based geodetic time series forecasting toolbox with python](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10560v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Geodetic time series -- such as Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) positions, satellite altimetry-derived sea surface height (SSH), and tide gauge (TG) records -- is essential for monitoring surface deformation and sea level change. Accurate forecasts of these variables can enhance early warning systems and support hazard mitigation for earthquakes, landslides, coastal storm surge, and long-term sea level. However, the nonlinear, non-stationary, and incomplete nature of such variables presents significant challenges for classic models, which often fail to capture long-term dependencies and complex spatiotemporal dynamics. We introduce GTS Forecaster, an open-source Python package for geodetic time series forecasting. It integrates advanced deep learning models -- including kernel attention networks (KAN), graph neural network-based gated recurrent units (GNNGRU), and time-aware graph neural networks (TimeGNN) -- to effectively model nonlinear spatial-temporal patterns. The package also provides robust preprocessing tools, including outlier detection and a reinforcement learning-based gap-filling algorithm, the Kalman-TransFusion Interpolation Framework (KTIF). GTS Forecaster currently supports forecasting, visualization, and evaluation of GNSS, SSH, and TG datasets, and is adaptable to general time series applications. By combining cutting-edge models with an accessible interface, it facilitates the application of deep learning in geodetic forecasting tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[IBN: An Interpretable Bidirectional-Modeling Network for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting with Variable Missing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07725v1)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF) often faces challenges from missing variables, which hinder conventional spatial-temporal graph neural networks in modeling inter-variable correlations. While GinAR addresses variable missing using attention-based imputation and adaptive graph learning for the first time, it lacks interpretability and fails to capture more latent temporal patterns due to its simple recursive units (RUs). To overcome these limitations, we propose the Interpretable Bidirectional-modeling Network (IBN), integrating Uncertainty-Aware Interpolation (UAI) and Gaussian kernel-based Graph Convolution (GGCN). IBN estimates the uncertainty of reconstructed values using MC Dropout and applies an uncertainty-weighted strategy to mitigate high-risk reconstructions. GGCN explicitly models spatial correlations among variables, while a bidirectional RU enhances temporal dependency modeling. Extensive experiments show that IBN achieves state-of-the-art forecasting performance under various missing-rate scenarios, providing a more reliable and interpretable framework for MTSF with missing variables.

Recently, egocentric videos, by directly capturing user focus, actions, and context in an unified coordinate, offer an exciting opportunity to enable proactive and personalized AI user experiences with MLLMs. However, existing benchmarks overlook the crucial role of gaze as an indicator of user intent. To address this gap, we introduce EgoGazeVQA, an egocentric gaze-guided video question answering benchmark that leverages gaze information to improve the understanding of longer daily-life videos. EgoGazeVQA consists of gaze-based QA pairs generated by MLLMs and refined by human annotators. Our experiments reveal that existing MLLMs struggle to accurately interpret user intentions. In contrast, our gaze-guided intent prompting methods significantly enhance performance by integrating spatial, temporal, and intent-related cues. We further conduct experiments on gaze-related fine-tuning and analyze how gaze estimation accuracy impacts prompting effectiveness. These results underscore the value of gaze for more personalized and effective AI assistants in egocentric settings.</p></details> |  |

In this work, the input data consists of adjacent surrounding frames and camera parameters. We propose a unified spatial-temporal-semantic fusion module to construct the visual fused features. Cross-attention components for surrounding cameras and adjacent frames are utilized to focus on metric scale information refinement and temporal feature matching. Building on this, we propose a pose estimation framework using surrounding cameras, their corresponding estimated depths, and extrinsic parameters, which effectively address the scale ambiguity in multi-camera setups. Moreover, semantic world model and monocular depth estimation world model are integrated to supervised the depth estimation, which improve the quality of depth estimation. We evaluate our algorithm on DDAD and nuScenes datasets, and the results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of surrounding camera based depth estimation quality.

This has led to considerable investment in bespoke modeling efforts translating sparse labels into maps. Here we introduce AlphaEarth Foundations, an embedding field model yielding a highly general, geospatial representation that assimilates spatial, temporal, and measurement contexts across multiple sources, enabling accurate and efficient production of maps and monitoring systems from local to global scales. The embeddings generated by AlphaEarth Foundations are the only to consistently outperform a suite of other well-known/widely accepted featurization approaches tested on a diverse set of mapping evaluations without re-training. We have released a dataset of global, annual, analysis-ready embedding field layers from 2017 through 2024.</p></details> |  |

Is it feasible to instead use readily available video captions as weak supervision? To address this question, we propose LASER, a neuro-symbolic framework to enable training STSG generators using only video captions. LASER employs large language models to first extract logical specifications with rich spatio-temporal semantic information from video captions. LASER then trains the underlying STSG generator to align the predicted STSG with the specification. The alignment algorithm overcomes the challenges of weak supervision by leveraging a differentiable symbolic reasoner and using a combination of contrastive, temporal, and semantics losses. The overall approach efficiently trains low-level perception models to extract a fine-grained STSG that conforms to the video caption. In doing so, it enables a novel methodology for learning STSGs without tedious annotations. We evaluate our method on three video datasets: OpenPVSG, 20BN, and MUGEN. Our approach demonstrates substantial improvements over fully-supervised baselines, achieving a unary predicate prediction accuracy of 27.78% (+12.65%) and a binary recall@5 of 0.42 (+0.22) on OpenPVSG. Additionally, LASER exceeds baselines by 7% on 20BN and 5.2% on MUGEN in terms of overall predicate prediction accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR) 2025</p></details> |

The Markov decision process (MDP) provides a structured framework for dynamic travel behavior modeling at the individual level. However, solving an MDP in this context is highly data-intensive and faces challenges of data quantity, spatial-temporal coverage, and situational diversity. To address these, we propose a group-effect-enhanced generative adversarial imitation learning (gcGAIL) model that improves the individual behavior modeling efficiency by leveraging shared behavioral patterns among passenger groups. We validate the gcGAIL model using a public transport fare-discount case study and compare against state-of-the-art benchmarks, including adversarial inverse reinforcement learning (AIRL), baseline GAIL, and conditional GAIL. Experimental results demonstrate that gcGAIL outperforms these methods in learning individual travel behavior responses to incentives over time in terms of accuracy, generalization, and pattern demonstration efficiency. Notably, gcGAIL is robust to spatial variation, data sparsity, and behavioral diversity, maintaining strong performance even with partial expert demonstrations and underrepresented passenger groups. The gcGAIL model predicts the individual behavior response at any time, providing the basis for personalized incentives to induce sustainable behavior changes (better timing of incentive injections).</p></details> |  |

The last is arguably the most challenging to model. Traditional SELD approaches typically rely on multichannel input, limiting their capacity to benefit from large-scale pre-training due to data constraints. To overcome this, we enhance a standard SELD architecture with semantic information by integrating pre-trained, contrastive language-aligned models: CLAP for audio and OWL-ViT for visual inputs. These embeddings are incorporated into a modified Conformer module tailored for multimodal fusion, which we refer to as the Cross-Modal Conformer. We perform an ablation study on the development set of the DCASE2025 Task3 Stereo SELD Dataset to assess the individual contributions of the language-aligned models and benchmark against the DCASE Task 3 baseline systems. Additionally, we detail the curation process of large synthetic audio and audio-visual datasets used for model pre-training. These datasets were further expanded through left-right channel swapping augmentation. Our approach, combining extensive pre-training, model ensembling, and visual post-processing, achieved second rank in the DCASE 2025 Challenge Task 3 (Track B), underscoring the effectiveness of our method. Future work will explore the modality-specific contributions and architectural refinements.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2507.04845</p></details> |

Traditional model-based techniques, such as game-theoretic methods and robust control, are often overly conservative or computationally intensive. Conversely, learning-based approaches typically require extensive training data and frequently exhibit limited interpretability and generalizability. Simpler strategies, such as Risk Potential Fields (RPF), provide lightweight alternatives with minimal data demands but are inherently static and struggle to adapt effectively to dynamic traffic conditions. To overcome these limitations, we propose the Evolutionary Risk Potential Field (ERPF), a novel approach that dynamically updates risk assessments in dynamical scenarios based on historical obstacle proximity data. We introduce a Risk-Ellipse construct that combines longitudinal reach and lateral uncertainty into a unified spatial temporal collision envelope. Additionally, we define an adaptive Evolution Factor metric, computed through sigmoid normalization of Time to Collision (TTC) and Time-Window-of-Hazard (TWH), which dynamically adjusts the dimensions of the ellipse axes in real time. This adaptive risk metric is integrated seamlessly into a Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework, enabling autonomous vehicles to proactively address complex interactive driving scenarios in terms of uncertain driving of surrounding vehicles. Comprehensive comparative experiments demonstrate that our ERPF-MPC approach consistently achieves smoother trajectories, higher average speeds, and collision-free navigation, offering a robust and adaptive solution suitable for complex interactive driving environments.</p></details> |  |

Traditional approaches commonly struggle with sensor misalignment, fail to fully leverage temporal information, and require extensive manual tuning to handle diverse sensor configurations. To address these problems, we introduce DVLO4D, a novel visual-LiDAR odometry framework that leverages sparse spatial-temporal fusion to enhance accuracy and robustness. Our approach proposes three key innovations: (1) Sparse Query Fusion, which utilizes sparse LiDAR queries for effective multi-modal data fusion; (2) a Temporal Interaction and Update module that integrates temporally-predicted positions with current frame data, providing better initialization values for pose estimation and enhancing model's robustness against accumulative errors; and (3) a Temporal Clip Training strategy combined with a Collective Average Loss mechanism that aggregates losses across multiple frames, enabling global optimization and reducing the scale drift over long sequences. Extensive experiments on the KITTI and Argoverse Odometry dataset demonstrate the superiority of our proposed DVLO4D, which achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of both pose accuracy and robustness. Additionally, our method has high efficiency, with an inference time of 82 ms, possessing the potential for the real-time deployment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICRA 2025</p></details> |

Traditionally, this task relies on experienced clinicians to manually annotate data, a process that is both time-consuming and labor-intensive. In recent years, deep learning methods have shown promise in automating this task. However, three major challenges remain: (1) deep learning models typically require large-scale labeled datasets, making them less effective in real-world settings where annotated data is limited; (2) significant inter-individual variability in bio-signals often results in inconsistent model performance when applied to new subjects, limiting generalization; and (3) existing approaches often overlook the high-order relationships among bio-signals, failing to simultaneously capture signal heterogeneity and spatial-temporal dependencies. To address these issues, we propose MetaSTH-Sleep, a few-shot sleep stage classification framework based on spatial-temporal hypergraph enhanced meta-learning. Our approach enables rapid adaptation to new subjects using only a few labeled samples, while the hypergraph structure effectively models complex spatial interconnections and temporal dynamics simultaneously in EEG signals.

| **[Towards Efficient General Feature Prediction in Masked Skeleton Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03609v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in the masked autoencoder (MAE) paradigm have significantly propelled self-supervised skeleton-based action recognition. However, most existing approaches limit reconstruction targets to raw joint coordinates or their simple variants, resulting in computational redundancy and limited semantic representation. To address this, we propose a novel General Feature Prediction framework (GFP) for efficient mask skeleton modeling. Our key innovation is replacing conventional low-level reconstruction with high-level feature prediction that spans from local motion patterns to global semantic representations. Specifically, we introduce a collaborative learning framework where a lightweight target generation network dynamically produces diversified supervision signals across spatial-temporal hierarchies, avoiding reliance on pre-computed offline features. The framework incorporates constrained optimization to ensure feature diversity while preventing model collapse. Experiments on NTU RGB+D 60, NTU RGB+D 120 and PKU-MMD demonstrate the benefits of our approach: Computational efficiency (with 6.2$\times$ faster training than standard masked skeleton modeling methods) and superior representation quality, achieving state-of-the-art performance in various downstream tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> |

Grounded in cognitive neuroscience, it integrates four core modules: the Information Preprocessor (thalamus-like), the Lifelong Embodied Memory System (hippocampus-like), the Closed-Loop Planning Module (prefrontal lobe-like), and the Low-Level Executer (cerebellum-like) to enable long-term planning and cumulative learning. The Lifelong Embodied Memory System, central to the framework, alleviates inference speed issues in complex memory frameworks via parallelized updates/retrieval across Spatial, Temporal, Episodic, and Semantic submodules. It incorporates a dynamic Knowledge Graph (KG) and consistent architectural design to enhance memory consistency and scalability. Evaluations on EmbodiedBench show RoboMemory outperforms the open-source baseline (Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Ins) by 25% in average success rate and surpasses the closed-source State-of-the-Art (SOTA) (Claude3.5-Sonnet) by 5%, establishing new SOTA. Ablation studies validate key components (critic, spatial memory, long-term memory), while real-world deployment confirms its lifelong learning capability with significantly improved success rates across repeated tasks. RoboMemory alleviates high latency challenges with scalability, serving as a foundational reference for integrating multi-modal memory systems in physical robots.</p></details> |  |
| **[See No Evil: Adversarial Attacks Against Linguistic-Visual Association in Referring Multi-Object Tracking Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02028v2)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Language-vision understanding has driven the development of advanced perception systems, most notably the emerging paradigm of Referring Multi-Object Tracking (RMOT). By leveraging natural-language queries, RMOT systems can selectively track objects that satisfy a given semantic description, guided through Transformer-based spatial-temporal reasoning modules. End-to-End (E2E) RMOT models further unify feature extraction, temporal memory, and spatial reasoning within a Transformer backbone, enabling long-range spatial-temporal modeling over fused textual-visual representations. Despite these advances, the reliability and robustness of RMOT remain underexplored. In this paper, we examine the security implications of RMOT systems from a design-logic perspective, identifying adversarial vulnerabilities that compromise both the linguistic-visual referring and track-object matching components. Additionally, we uncover a novel vulnerability in advanced RMOT models employing FIFO-based memory, whereby targeted and consistent attacks on their spatial-temporal reasoning introduce errors that persist within the history buffer over multiple subsequent frames. We present VEIL, a novel adversarial framework designed to disrupt the unified referring-matching mechanisms of RMOT models. We show that carefully crafted digital and physical perturbations can corrupt the tracking logic reliability, inducing track ID switches and terminations. We conduct comprehensive evaluations using the Refer-KITTI dataset to validate the effectiveness of VEIL and demonstrate the urgent need for security-aware RMOT designs for critical large-scale applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 1 figure, 3 tables</p></details> |

However, existing methods may fail to model dependencies across multiple spatial-temporal scales (ST-scales, i.e., scales that jointly consider spatial and temporal scopes). In this work, we propose ST-Hyper to model the high-order dependencies across multiple ST-scales through adaptive hypergraph modeling. Specifically, we introduce a Spatial-Temporal Pyramid Modeling (STPM) module to extract features at multiple ST-scales. Furthermore, we introduce an Adaptive Hypergraph Modeling (AHM) module that learns a sparse hypergraph to capture robust high-order dependencies among features. In addition, we interact with these features through tri-phase hypergraph propagation, which can comprehensively capture multi-scale spatial-temporal dynamics. Experimental results on six real-world MTS datasets demonstrate that ST-Hyper achieves the state-of-the-art performance, outperforming the best baselines with an average MAE reduction of 3.8\% and 6.8\% for long-term and short-term forecasting, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CIKM 2025</p></details> |

Future order distribution information, which reflects the distribution of orders in on-demand food delivery, is crucial for the performance of logistical demand-supply forecasting. Current studies utilize spatial-temporal analysis methods to model future order distribution information from serious time slices. However, learning future order distribution in online delivery platform is a time-series-insensitive problem with strong randomness. These approaches often struggle to effectively capture this information while remaining efficient. This paper proposes an innovative spatiotemporal learning model that utilizes only two graphs (ongoing and global) to learn future order distribution information, achieving superior performance compared to traditional spatial-temporal long-series methods. The main contributions are as follows: (1) The introduction of ongoing and global graphs in logistical demand-supply pressure forecasting compared to traditional long time series significantly enhances forecasting performance. (2) An innovative graph learning network framework using adaptive future graph learning and innovative cross attention mechanism (ACA-Net) is proposed to extract future order distribution information, effectively learning a robust future graph that substantially improves logistical demand-supply pressure forecasting outcomes. (3) The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated in real-world production environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, DASFAA2025 conference full paper</p></details> |

Eye Tracking-Based Modeling of Situational Awareness in Augmented Reality](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05025v2)** | 2025-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Augmented Reality (AR) systems, while enhancing task performance through real-time guidance, pose risks of inducing cognitive tunneling-a hyperfocus on virtual content that compromises situational awareness (SA) in safety-critical scenarios. This paper investigates SA in AR-guided cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), where responders must balance effective compressions with vigilance to unpredictable hazards (e.g., patient vomiting). We developed an AR app on a Magic Leap 2 that overlays real-time CPR feedback (compression depth and rate) and conducted a user study with simulated unexpected incidents (e.g., bleeding) to evaluate SA, in which SA metrics were collected via observation and questionnaires administered during freeze-probe events. Eye tracking analysis revealed that higher SA levels were associated with greater saccadic amplitude and velocity, and with reduced proportion and frequency of fixations on virtual content. To predict SA, we propose FixGraphPool, a graph neural network that structures gaze events (fixations, saccades) into spatiotemporal graphs, effectively capturing dynamic attentional patterns. Our model achieved 83.0% accuracy (F1=81.0%), outperforming feature-based machine learning and state-of-the-art time-series models by leveraging domain knowledge and spatial-temporal information encoded in ET data. These findings demonstrate the potential of eye tracking for SA modeling in AR and highlight its utility in designing AR systems that ensure user safety and situational awareness.</p></details> |  |
| **[LiFeChain: Lightweight Blockchain for Secure and Efficient Federated Lifelong Learning in IoT](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01434v1)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The expansion of Internet of Things (IoT) devices constantly generates heterogeneous data streams, driving demand for continuous, decentralized intelligence. Federated Lifelong Learning (FLL) provides an ideal solution by incorporating federated and lifelong learning to overcome catastrophic forgetting. The extended lifecycle of FLL in IoT systems increases their vulnerability to persistent attacks, and these risks may be obscured by performance degradation caused by spatial-temporal data heterogeneity. Moreover, this problem is exacerbated by the standard single-server architecture, as its single point of failure makes it difficult to maintain a reliable audit trail for long-term threats. Blockchain provides a tamper-proof foundation for trustworthy FLL systems. Nevertheless, directly applying blockchain to FLL significantly increases computational and retrieval costs with the expansion of the knowledge base, slowing down the training on IoT devices. To address these challenges, we propose LiFeChain, a lightweight blockchain for secure and efficient federated lifelong learning by providing a tamper-resistant ledger with minimal on-chain disclosure and bidirectional verification. To the best of our knowledge, LiFeChain is the first blockchain tailored for FLL. LiFeChain incorporates two complementary mechanisms: the proof-of-model-correlation (PoMC) consensus on the server, which couples learning and unlearning mechanisms to mitigate negative transfer, and segmented zero-knowledge arbitration (Seg-ZA) on the client, which detects and arbitrates abnormal committee behavior without compromising privacy. LiFeChain is designed as a plug-and-play component that can be seamlessly integrated into existing FLL algorithms. Experimental results demonstrate that LiFeChain not only enhances model performance against two long-term attacks but also sustains high efficiency and scalability.</p></details> |  |

| **[A Risk-aware Spatial-temporal Trajectory Planning Framework for Autonomous Vehicles Using QP-MPC and Dynamic Hazard Fields](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00643v1)** | 2025-08-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory planning is a critical component in ensuring the safety, stability, and efficiency of autonomous vehicles. While existing trajectory planning methods have achieved progress, they often suffer from high computational costs, unstable performance in dynamic environments, and limited validation across diverse scenarios. To overcome these challenges, we propose an enhanced QP-MPC-based framework that incorporates three key innovations: (i) a novel cost function designed with a dynamic hazard field, which explicitly balances safety, efficiency, and comfort; (ii) seamless integration of this cost function into the QP-MPC formulation, enabling direct optimization of desired driving behaviors; and (iii) extensive validation of the proposed framework across complex tasks. The spatial safe planning is guided by a dynamic hazard field (DHF) for risk assessment, while temporal safe planning is based on a space-time graph. Besides, the quintic polynomial sampling and sub-reward of comforts are used to ensure comforts during lane-changing. The sub-reward of efficiency is used to maintain driving efficiency. Finally, the proposed DHF-enhanced objective function integrates multiple objectives, providing a proper optimization tasks for QP-MPC. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms benchmark optimization methods in terms of efficiency, stability, and comfort across a variety of scenarios likes lane-changing, overtaking, and crossing intersections.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Convolutional Network With Pattern-Spatial Interactive and Regional Awareness for Traffic Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00515v1)** | 2025-08-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic forecasting is significant for urban traffic management, intelligent route planning, and real-time flow monitoring. Recent advances in spatial-temporal models have markedly improved the modeling of intricate spatial-temporal correlations for traffic forecasting. Unfortunately, most previous studies have encountered challenges in effectively modeling spatial-temporal correlations across various perceptual perspectives, which have neglected the interactive fusion between traffic patterns and spatial correlations. Additionally, constrained by spatial heterogeneity, most studies fail to consider distinct regional heterogeneity during message-passing. To overcome these limitations, we propose a Pattern-Spatial Interactive and Regional Awareness Graph Convolutional Network (PSIRAGCN) for traffic forecasting. Specifically, we propose a pattern-spatial interactive fusion framework composed of pattern and spatial modules. This framework aims to capture patterns and spatial correlations by adopting a perception perspective from the global to the local level and facilitating mutual utilization with positive feedback. In the spatial module, we designed a graph convolutional network based on message-passing. The network is designed to leverage a regional characteristics bank to reconstruct data-driven message-passing with regional awareness. Reconstructed message passing can reveal the regional heterogeneity between nodes in the traffic network. Extensive experiments on three real-world traffic datasets demonstrate that PSIRAGCN outperforms the State-of-the-art baseline while balancing computational costs.</p></details> |  |

Therefore, healthcare providers and individuals need accessible and reliable forecasting tools for preventive interventions. This paper introduces an interpretable, individualized two-stage adaptive spatial-temporal model for predicting sleep quality scores. Our proposed framework combines multi-scale convolutional layers to model spatial interactions across multiple input variables, recurrent layers and attention mechanisms to capture long-term temporal dependencies, and a two-stage domain adaptation strategy to enhance generalization. The first adaptation stage is applied during training to mitigate overfitting on the training set. In the second stage, a source-free test-time adaptation mechanism is employed to adapt the model to new users without requiring labels. We conducted various experiments with five input window sizes (3, 5, 7, 9, and 11 days) and five prediction window sizes (1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 days). Our model consistently outperformed time series forecasting baseline approaches, including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Informer, PatchTST, and TimesNet. The best performance was achieved with a three-day input window and a one-day prediction window, yielding a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.216. Furthermore, the model demonstrated good predictive performance even for longer forecasting horizons (e.g, with a 0.257 RMSE for a three-day prediction window), highlighting its practical utility for real-world applications. We also conducted an explainability analysis to examine how different features influence sleep quality. These findings proved that the proposed framework offers a robust, adaptive, and explainable solution for personalized sleep forecasting using sparse data from commercial wearable devices.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quantifying the Improvement of Accessibility achieved via Shared Mobility on Demand](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13100v2)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Shared Mobility Services (SMS), e.g., demand-responsive transport or ride-sharing, can improve mobility in low-density areas, which are often poorly served by conventional Public Transport (PT). Such improvement is generally measured via basic performance indicators, such as waiting or travel time. However, such basic indicators do not account for the most important contribution that SMS can provide to territories, i.e., increasing the potential, for users, to reach surrounding opportunities, such as jobs, schools, businesses, etc. Such potential can be measured by isochrone-based accessibility indicators, which count the number of opportunities reachable in a limited time, and are thus easy for the public to understand. % The potential impact of SMS on accessibility has been qualitatively discussed and implications on equity have been empirically studied. However, to date, there are no quantitative methods to compute isochrone-based indicators of the accessibility achieved via SMS. This work fills this gap by proposing a first method to compute isochrone accessibility of PT systems composed of conventional PT and SMS, acting as a feeder for access and egress trips to/from PT hubs. This method is grounded on spatial-temporal statistical analysis, performed via Kriging. It takes as input observed trips of SMS and summarizes them in a graph. On such a graph, isochrone accessibility indicators are computed. We apply the proposed method to a MATSim simulation study concerning demand-responsive transport integrated into PT, in the suburban area of Paris-Saclay.</p></details> |  |

Accurate and early diagnosis of MTS using computed tomography (CT) remains a clinical challenge due to the subtle anatomical compression and variability across patients. In this paper, we propose MTS-Net, an end-to-end 3D deep learning framework designed to capture spatial-temporal patterns from CT volumes for reliable MTS diagnosis. MTS-Net builds upon 3D ResNet-18 by embedding a novel dual-enhanced positional multi-head self-attention (DEP-MHSA) module into the Transformer encoder of the network's final stages. The proposed DEP-MHSA employs multi-scale convolution and integrates positional embeddings into both attention weights and residual paths, enhancing spatial context preservation, which is crucial for identifying venous compression. To validate our approach, we curate the first publicly available dataset for MTS, MTS-CT, containing over 747 gender-balanced subjects with standard and enhanced CT scans. Experimental results demonstrate that MTS-Net achieves average 0.79 accuracy, 0.84 AUC, and 0.78 F1-score, outperforming baseline models including 3D ResNet, DenseNet-BC, and BabyNet. Our work not only introduces a new diagnostic architecture for MTS but also provides a high-quality benchmark dataset to facilitate future research in automated vascular syndrome detection.

This work introduces a novel context-aware zero-shot anomaly detection framework that identifies abnormal events without exposure to anomaly examples during training. The proposed hybrid architecture combines TimeSformer, DPC, and CLIP to model spatiotemporal dynamics and semantic context. TimeSformer serves as the vision backbone to extract rich spatial-temporal features, while DPC forecasts future representations to identify temporal deviations. Furthermore, a CLIP-based semantic stream enables concept-level anomaly detection through context-specific text prompts. These components are jointly trained using InfoNCE and CPC losses, aligning visual inputs with their temporal and semantic representations. A context-gating mechanism further enhances decision-making by modulating predictions with scene-aware cues or global video features. By integrating predictive modeling with vision-language understanding, the system can generalize to previously unseen behaviors in complex environments. This framework bridges the gap between temporal reasoning and semantic context in zero-shot anomaly detection for surveillance. The code for this research has been made available at https://github.com/NK-II/Context-Aware-Zero-Shot-Anomaly-Detection-in-Surveillance.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 7 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

We present DALIA, a highly scalable framework for performing Bayesian inference tasks on spatio-temporal multivariate GPs, based on the methodology of integrated nested Laplace approximations. Our approach relies on a sparse inverse covariance matrix formulation of the GP, puts forward a GPU-accelerated block-dense approach, and introduces a hierarchical, triple-layer, distributed memory parallel scheme. We showcase weak scaling performance surpassing the state-of-the-art by two orders of magnitude on a model whose parameter space is 8$\times$ larger and measure strong scaling speedups of three orders of magnitude when running on 496 GH200 superchips on the Alps supercomputer. Applying DALIA to air pollution data from northern Italy over 48 days, we showcase refined spatial resolutions over the aggregated pollutant measurements.</p></details> |  |

However, generating high-speed, high-quality holographic video requires both high frame rate display and efficient computation, but is constrained by two key limitations: ($i$) Learning-based models often produce over-smoothed phases with narrow angular spectra, causing severe color crosstalk in high frame rate full-color displays such as depth-division multiplexing and thus resulting in a trade-off between frame rate and color fidelity. ($ii$) Existing frame-by-frame optimization methods typically optimize frames independently, neglecting spatial-temporal correlations between consecutive frames and leading to computationally inefficient solutions. To overcome these challenges, in this paper, we propose a novel high-speed full-color video CGH generation scheme. First, we introduce Spectrum-Guided Depth Division Multiplexing (SGDDM), which optimizes phase distributions via frequency modulation, enabling high-fidelity full-color display at high frame rates. Second, we present HoloMamba, a lightweight asymmetric Mamba-Unet architecture that explicitly models spatial-temporal correlations across video sequences to enhance reconstruction quality and computational efficiency. Extensive simulated and real-world experiments demonstrate that SGDDM achieves high-fidelity full-color display without compromise in frame rate, while HoloMamba generates FHD (1080p) full-color holographic video at over 260 FPS, more than 2.6$\times$ faster than the prior state-of-the-art Divide-Conquer-and-Merge Strategy.</p></details> |  |

We focus on a team of robots with diverse capabilities tasked with executing missions specified using Capability Temporal Logic (CaTL), a formal framework built on Signal Temporal Logic to handle spatial, temporal, capability, and resource constraints. The key challenge arises from the uncertainty in the initial distribution and quantity of resources in the environment. To address this, we introduce an iterative algorithm that dynamically balances exploration and task fulfillment. Robots are guided to explore the environment, identifying resource locations and quantities while progressively refining their understanding of the resource landscape. At the same time, they aim to maximally satisfy the mission objectives based on the current information, adapting their strategies as new data is uncovered. This approach provides a robust solution for planning in dynamic, resource-constrained environments, enabling efficient coordination of heterogeneous teams even under conditions of uncertainty. Our method's effectiveness and performance are demonstrated through simulated case studies.</p></details> |  |

The Micro-gesture Online Recognition task is a highly challenging problem that aims to locate the temporal positions and recognize the categories of multiple micro-gesture instances in untrimmed videos. Compared to traditional temporal action detection, this task places greater emphasis on distinguishing between micro-gesture categories and precisely identifying the start and end times of each instance. Moreover, micro-gestures are typically spontaneous human actions, with greater differences than those found in other human actions. To address these challenges, we propose hand-crafted data augmentation and spatial-temporal attention to enhance the model's ability to classify and localize micro-gestures more accurately. Our solution achieved an F1 score of 38.03, outperforming the previous state-of-the-art by 37.9%. As a result, our method ranked first in the Micro-gesture Online Recognition track.</p></details> | 11 pages, 4 figures |

Specifically, we consider a single UAV with 3 degree-of-freedom dynamics tasked with delivering blood packages to multiple hospitals, each with a predefined time window and priority. Mission objectives are encoded using Signal Temporal Logic (STL), enabling the formal specification of spatial-temporal constraints. To ensure safety, city buildings are modeled as 3D convex obstacles, and obstacle avoidance is handled through a Convex Feasible Set (CFS) method. The entire planning problem-combining UAV dynamics, STL satisfaction, and collision avoidance-is formulated as a convex optimization problem that ensures tractability and can be solved efficiently using standard convex programming techniques. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method generates dynamically feasible, collision-free trajectories that satisfy temporal mission goals, providing a scalable and reliable approach for autonomous UAV-based medical logistics.</p></details> | 11 pages, 4 figures |

Nonetheless, they exhibit persistent limitations on tasks that require explicit reasoning over entities, roles, and spatio-temporal relations. Such relational competence is indispensable for fine-grained human activity recognition, egocentric video understanding, and multimodal medical image analysis, where spatial, temporal, and semantic dependencies are decisive for performance. We advance the position that next-generation FMs should incorporate explicit relational interfaces, instantiated as dynamic relational graphs (graphs whose topology and edge semantics are inferred from the input and task context). We illustrate this position with cross-domain evidence from recent systems in human manipulation action recognition and brain tumor segmentation, showing that augmenting FMs with lightweight, context-adaptive graph-reasoning modules improves fine-grained semantic fidelity, out of distribution robustness, interpretability, and computational efficiency relative to FM only baselines. Importantly, by reasoning sparsely over semantic nodes, such hybrids also achieve favorable memory and hardware efficiency, enabling deployment under practical resource constraints. We conclude with a targeted research agenda for FM graph hybrids, prioritizing learned dynamic graph construction, multi-level relational reasoning (e.g., part object scene in activity understanding, or region organ in medical imaging), cross-modal fusion, and evaluation protocols that directly probe relational competence in structured vision tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Analysis and Detection of RIS-based Spoofing in Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18100v1)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is a key feature of next-generation 6G wireless systems, allowing them to achieve high data rates and sensing accuracy. While prior research has primarily focused on addressing communication safety in ISAC systems, the equally critical issue of sensing safety remains largely under-explored. In this paper, the possibility of spoofing the sensing function of ISAC in vehicle networks is examined, whereby a malicious reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is deployed to compromise the sensing functionality of a roadside unit (RSU). For this scenario, the requirements on the malicious RIS' phase shifts design and number of reflecting elements are analyzed. Under such spoofing, the practical estimation bias of the vehicular user (VU)'s Doppler shift and angle-of-departure (AoD) for an arbitrary time slot is analytically derived. Moreover, from the attacker's view, a Markov decision process (MDP) is formulated to optimize the RIS' phase shifts design. The goal of this MDP is to generate complete and plausible fake trajectories by incorporating the concept of spatial-temporal consistency. To defend against this sensing spoofing attack, a signal temporal logic (STL)-based neuro-symbolic attack detection framework is proposed and shown to learn interoperable formulas for identifying spoofed trajectories.</p></details> |  |

However, existing works suffer from the generalization problem, \ie, they are either restricted to train for specific regions or only suitable for a few tasks. Given the recent advances of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), we raise the question: can MLLMs reform current trajectory data mining and solve the problem? Nevertheless, due to the modality gap of trajectory, how to generate task-independent multimodal trajectory representations and how to adapt flexibly to different tasks remain the foundational challenges. In this paper, we propose \texttt{Traj-MLLM}}, which is the first general framework using MLLMs for trajectory data mining. By integrating multiview contexts, \texttt{Traj-MLLM}} transforms raw trajectories into interleaved image-text sequences while preserving key spatial-temporal characteristics, and directly utilizes the reasoning ability of MLLMs for trajectory analysis. Additionally, a prompt optimization method is proposed to finalize data-invariant prompts for task adaptation. Extensive experiments on four publicly available datasets show that \texttt{Traj-MLLM}} outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by $48.05\%$, $15.52\%$, $51.52\%$, $1.83\%$ on travel time estimation, mobility prediction, anomaly detection and transportation mode identification, respectively. \texttt{Traj-MLLM}} achieves these superior performances without requiring any training data or fine-tuning the MLLM backbones.</p></details> | 20 pages, 10 figures |

It is motivated by the fact that HOI is crucial for human-centric video content understanding. To solve ST-HOID, we propose a novel method consisting of an object trajectory detection module and an interaction reasoning module. Furthermore, we construct the first dataset named VidOR-HOID for ST-HOID evaluation, which contains 10,831 spatial-temporal HOI instances. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of our method. The experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the baselines generated by the state-of-the-art methods of image human-object interaction detection, video visual relation detection and video human-object interaction recognition.</p></details> |  |
| **[Physics-Inspired Spatial Temporal Graph Neural Networks for Predicting Industrial Chain Resilience](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16836v1)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Industrial chain plays an increasingly important role in the sustainable development of national economy. However, as a typical complex network, data-driven deep learning is still in its infancy in describing and analyzing the resilience of complex networks, and its core is the lack of a theoretical framework to describe the system dynamics. In this paper, we propose a physically informative neural symbolic approach to describe the evolutionary dynamics of complex networks for resilient prediction. The core idea is to learn the dynamics of the activity state of physical entities and integrate it into the multi-layer spatiotemporal co-evolution network, and use the physical information method to realize the joint learning of physical symbol dynamics and spatiotemporal co-evolution topology, so as to predict the industrial chain resilience. The experimental results show that the model can obtain better results and predict the elasticity of the industry chain more accurately and effectively, which has certain practical significance for the development of the industry.</p></details> |  |
| **[MuST2-Learn: Multi-view Spatial-Temporal-Type Learning for Heterogeneous Municipal Service Time Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16503v1)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Non-emergency municipal services such as city 311 systems have been widely implemented across cities in Canada and the United States to enhance residents' quality of life. These systems enable residents to report issues, e.g., noise complaints, missed garbage collection, and potholes, via phone calls, mobile applications, or webpages. However, residents are often given limited information about when their service requests will be addressed, which can reduce transparency, lower resident satisfaction, and increase the number of follow-up inquiries. Predicting the service time for municipal service requests is challenging due to several complex factors: dynamic spatial-temporal correlations, underlying interactions among heterogeneous service request types, and high variation in service duration even within the same request category. In this work, we propose MuST2-Learn: a Multi-view Spatial-Temporal-Type Learning framework designed to address the aforementioned challenges by jointly modeling spatial, temporal, and service type dimensions. In detail, it incorporates an inter-type encoder to capture relationships among heterogeneous service request types and an intra-type variation encoder to model service time variation within homogeneous types. In addition, a spatiotemporal encoder is integrated to capture spatial and temporal correlations in each request type. The proposed framework is evaluated with extensive experiments using two real-world datasets. The results show that MuST2-Learn reduces mean absolute error by at least 32.5%, which outperforms state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to SIGSPATIAL 2025</p></details> |

Successful utilisation of micromobilities requires optimisation of complex systems for efficiency, environmental impact mitigation, and overcoming technical challenges for user safety. Machine Learning (ML) methods have been crucial to support these advancements and to address their unique challenges. However, there is insufficient literature addressing the specific issues of ML applications in micromobilities. This survey paper addresses this gap by providing a comprehensive review of datasets, ML techniques, and their specific applications in micromobilities. Specifically, we collect and analyse various micromobility-related datasets and discuss them in terms of spatial, temporal, and feature-based characteristics. In addition, we provide a detailed overview of ML models applied in micromobilities, introducing their advantages, challenges, and specific use cases. Furthermore, we explore multiple ML applications, such as demand prediction, energy management, and safety, focusing on improving efficiency, accuracy, and user experience. Finally, we propose future research directions to address these issues, aiming to help future researchers better understand this field.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 3 tables, and 4 figures, submitted to IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles</p></details> |

However, existing generation works predominantly concentrate on the creation of static scenes or narrow perspective-view dynamic scenes, falling short of delivering a truly 360-degree immersive experience from any viewpoint. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{TiP4GEN}, an advanced text-to-dynamic panorama scene generation framework that enables fine-grained content control and synthesizes motion-rich, geometry-consistent panoramic 4D scenes. TiP4GEN integrates panorama video generation and dynamic scene reconstruction to create 360-degree immersive virtual environments. For video generation, we introduce a \textbf{Dual-branch Generation Model} consisting of a panorama branch and a perspective branch, responsible for global and local view generation, respectively. A bidirectional cross-attention mechanism facilitates comprehensive information exchange between the branches. For scene reconstruction, we propose a \textbf{Geometry-aligned Reconstruction Model} based on 3D Gaussian Splatting. By aligning spatial-temporal point clouds using metric depth maps and initializing scene cameras with estimated poses, our method ensures geometric consistency and temporal coherence for the reconstructed scenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed designs and the superiority of TiP4GEN in generating visually compelling and motion-coherent dynamic panoramic scenes.

| **[STGAtt: A Spatial-Temporal Unified Graph Attention Network for Traffic Flow Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16685v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate and timely traffic flow forecasting is crucial for intelligent transportation systems. This paper presents a novel deep learning model, the Spatial-Temporal Unified Graph Attention Network (STGAtt). By leveraging a unified graph representation and an attention mechanism, STGAtt effectively captures complex spatial-temporal dependencies. Unlike methods relying on separate spatial and temporal dependency modeling modules, STGAtt directly models correlations within a Spatial-Temporal Unified Graph, dynamically weighing connections across both dimensions. To further enhance its capabilities, STGAtt partitions traffic flow observation signal into neighborhood subsets and employs a novel exchanging mechanism, enabling effective capture of both short-range and long-range correlations. Extensive experiments on the PEMS-BAY and SHMetro datasets demonstrate STGAtt's superior performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines across various prediction horizons. Visualization of attention weights confirms STGAtt's ability to adapt to dynamic traffic patterns and capture long-range dependencies, highlighting its potential for real-world traffic flow forecasting applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploring Spatial-Temporal Dynamics in Event-based Facial Micro-Expression Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11988v2)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Micro-expression analysis has applications in domains such as Human-Robot Interaction and Driver Monitoring Systems. Accurately capturing subtle and fast facial movements remains difficult when relying solely on RGB cameras, due to limitations in temporal resolution and sensitivity to motion blur. Event cameras offer an alternative, with microsecond-level precision, high dynamic range, and low latency. However, public datasets featuring event-based recordings of Action Units are still scarce. In this work, we introduce a novel, preliminary multi-resolution and multi-modal micro-expression dataset recorded with synchronized RGB and event cameras under variable lighting conditions. Two baseline tasks are evaluated to explore the spatial-temporal dynamics of micro-expressions: Action Unit classification using Spiking Neural Networks (51.23\% accuracy with events vs. 23.12\% with RGB), and frame reconstruction using Conditional Variational Autoencoders, achieving SSIM = 0.8513 and PSNR = 26.89 dB with high-resolution event input. These promising results show that event-based data can be used for micro-expression recognition and frame reconstruction.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Empirical Study on How Video-LLMs Answer Video Questions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15360v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Taking advantage of large-scale data and pretrained language models, Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) have shown strong capabilities in answering video questions. However, most existing efforts focus on improving performance, with limited attention to understanding their internal mechanisms. This paper aims to bridge this gap through a systematic empirical study. To interpret existing VideoLLMs, we adopt attention knockouts as our primary analytical tool and design three variants: Video Temporal Knockout, Video Spatial Knockout, and Language-to-Video Knockout. Then, we apply these three knockouts on different numbers of layers (window of layers). By carefully controlling the window of layers and types of knockouts, we provide two settings: a global setting and a fine-grained setting. Our study reveals three key findings: (1) Global setting indicates Video information extraction primarily occurs in early layers, forming a clear two-stage process -- lower layers focus on perceptual encoding, while higher layers handle abstract reasoning; (2) In the fine-grained setting, certain intermediate layers exert an outsized impact on video question answering, acting as critical outliers, whereas most other layers contribute minimally; (3) In both settings, we observe that spatial-temporal modeling relies more on language-guided retrieval than on intra- and inter-frame self-attention among video tokens, despite the latter's high computational cost. Finally, we demonstrate that these insights can be leveraged to reduce attention computation in Video-LLMs. To our knowledge, this is the first work to systematically uncover how Video-LLMs internally process and understand video content, offering interpretability and efficiency perspectives for future research.</p></details> |  |

This thesis presents a real-time, inpainting-based DR system designed to enable privacy control in shared-space mixed reality (MR) meetings. The system allows a primary headset user to selectively remove personal or sensitive items from their environment, ensuring that those objects are no longer visible to other participants. Removal is achieved through semantic segmentation and precise object selection, followed by real-time inpainting from the viewpoint of a secondary observer, implemented using a mobile ZED 2i depth camera. The solution is designed to be portable and robust, requiring neither a fixed secondary viewpoint nor prior 3D scanning of the environment. The system utilises YOLOv11 for object detection and a modified Decoupled Spatial-Temporal Transformer (DSTT) model for high-quality video inpainting. At 720p resolution, the pipeline sustains frame rates exceeding 20 fps, demonstrating the feasibility of real-time diminished reality for practical privacy-preserving MR applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>50 pa...</summary><p>50 pages, 12 figures | Demo video: https://youtu.be/udBxj35GEKI?t=499 | Code: https://github.com/c1h1r1i1s1 (multiple repositories)</p></details> |
| **[Tinker: Diffusion's Gift to 3D--Multi-View Consistent Editing From Sparse Inputs without Per-Scene Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14811v1)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Tinker, a versatile framework for high-fidelity 3D editing that operates in both one-shot and few-shot regimes without any per-scene finetuning. Unlike prior techniques that demand extensive per-scene optimization to ensure multi-view consistency or to produce dozens of consistent edited input views, Tinker delivers robust, multi-view consistent edits from as few as one or two images. This capability stems from repurposing pretrained diffusion models, which unlocks their latent 3D awareness. To drive research in this space, we curate the first large-scale multi-view editing dataset and data pipeline, spanning diverse scenes and styles. Building on this dataset, we develop our framework capable of generating multi-view consistent edited views without per-scene training, which consists of two novel components: (1) Referring multi-view editor: Enables precise, reference-driven edits that remain coherent across all viewpoints. (2) Any-view-to-video synthesizer: Leverages spatial-temporal priors from video diffusion to perform high-quality scene completion and novel-view generation even from sparse inputs. Through extensive experiments, Tinker significantly reduces the barrier to generalizable 3D content creation, achieving state-of-the-art performance on editing, novel-view synthesis, and rendering enhancement tasks. We believe that Tinker represents a key step towards truly scalable, zero-shot 3D editing.

To address these challenges, we present TRUST-Planner, a topology-guided hierarchical planning framework for robust spatial-temporal obstacle avoidance. In the frontend, a dynamic enhanced visible probabilistic roadmap (DEV-PRM) is proposed to rapidly explore topological paths for global guidance. The backend utilizes a uniform terminal-free minimum control polynomial (UTF-MINCO) and dynamic distance field (DDF) to enable efficient predictive obstacle avoidance and fast parallel computation. Furthermore, an incremental multi-branch trajectory management framework is introduced to enable spatio-temporal topological decision-making, while efficiently leveraging historical information to reduce replanning time. Simulation results show that TRUST-Planner outperforms baseline competitors, achieving a 96\% success rate and millisecond-level computation efficiency in tested complex environments. Real-world experiments further validate the feasibility and practicality of the proposed method.</p></details> |  |
| **[UST-SSM: Unified Spatio-Temporal State Space Models for Point Cloud Video Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14604v1)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Point cloud videos capture dynamic 3D motion while reducing the effects of lighting and viewpoint variations, making them highly effective for recognizing subtle and continuous human actions. Although Selective State Space Models (SSMs) have shown good performance in sequence modeling with linear complexity, the spatio-temporal disorder of point cloud videos hinders their unidirectional modeling when directly unfolding the point cloud video into a 1D sequence through temporally sequential scanning. To address this challenge, we propose the Unified Spatio-Temporal State Space Model (UST-SSM), which extends the latest advancements in SSMs to point cloud videos. Specifically, we introduce Spatial-Temporal Selection Scanning (STSS), which reorganizes unordered points into semantic-aware sequences through prompt-guided clustering, thereby enabling the effective utilization of points that are spatially and temporally distant yet similar within the sequence. For missing 4D geometric and motion details, Spatio-Temporal Structure Aggregation (STSA) aggregates spatio-temporal features and compensates. To improve temporal interaction within the sampled sequence, Temporal Interaction Sampling (TIS) enhances fine-grained temporal dependencies through non-anchor frame utilization and expanded receptive fields. Experimental results on the MSR-Action3D, NTU RGB+D, and Synthia 4D datasets validate the effectiveness of our method.

This paper specifically focuses on a subset of body actions known as micro-actions, which are subtle, low-intensity body movements with promising applications in human emotion analysis. In real-world scenarios, human micro-actions often temporally co-occur, with multiple micro-actions overlapping in time, such as concurrent head and hand movements. However, current research primarily focuses on recognizing individual micro-actions while overlooking their co-occurring nature. To address this gap, we propose a new task named Multi-label Micro-Action Detection (MMAD), which involves identifying all micro-actions in a given short video, determining their start and end times, and categorizing them. Accomplishing this requires a model capable of accurately capturing both long-term and short-term action relationships to detect multiple overlapping micro-actions. To facilitate the MMAD task, we introduce a new dataset named Multi-label Micro-Action-52 (MMA-52) and propose a baseline method equipped with a dual-path spatial-temporal adapter to address the challenges of subtle visual change in MMAD. We hope that MMA-52 can stimulate research on micro-action analysis in videos and prompt the development of spatio-temporal modeling in human-centric video understanding. The proposed MMA-52 dataset is available at: https://github.com/VUT-HFUT/Micro-Action.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> |

This paper proposes SST-CL, a novel framework integrating spatial-temporal transformers with curriculum learning. Our method introduces two core components: a spatial encoder that models inter-channel relationships and a temporal encoder that captures multi-scale dependencies through windowed attention mechanisms, enabling simultaneous extraction of spatial correlations and temporal dynamics from EEG signals. Complementing this architecture, an intensity-aware curriculum learning strategy progressively guides training from high-intensity to low-intensity emotional states through dynamic sample scheduling based on a dual difficulty assessment. Comprehensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across various emotional intensity levels, with ablation studies confirming the necessity of both architectural components and the curriculum learning mechanism.</p></details> |  |

While current methods mainly focus on predicting the next location for personalized services like recommendations, they often fall short in supporting broader applications such as traffic management and epidemic control, which require longer period forecasts of human mobility. This study addresses mid-term mobility prediction, aiming to capture daily travel patterns and forecast trajectories for the upcoming day or week. We propose a novel Multi-scale Spatial-Temporal Decoupled Predictor (MSTDP) designed to efficiently extract spatial and temporal information by decoupling daily trajectories into distinct location-duration chains. Our approach employs a hierarchical encoder to model multi-scale temporal patterns, including daily recurrence and weekly periodicity, and utilizes a transformer-based decoder to globally attend to predicted information in the location or duration chain. Additionally, we introduce a spatial heterogeneous graph learner to capture multi-scale spatial relationships, enhancing semantic-rich representations. Extensive experiments, including statistical physics analysis, are conducted on large-scale mobile phone records in five cities (Boston, Los Angeles, SF Bay Area, Shanghai, and Tokyo), to demonstrate MSTDP's advantages. Applied to epidemic modeling in Boston, MSTDP significantly outperforms the best-performing baseline, achieving a remarkable 62.8% reduction in MAE for cumulative new cases.</p></details> |  |
| **[STAS: Spatio-Temporal Adaptive Computation Time for Spiking Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14138v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spiking neural networks (SNNs) offer energy efficiency over artificial neural networks (ANNs) but suffer from high latency and computational overhead due to their multi-timestep operational nature. While various dynamic computation methods have been developed to mitigate this by targeting spatial, temporal, or architecture-specific redundancies, they remain fragmented. While the principles of adaptive computation time (ACT) offer a robust foundation for a unified approach, its application to SNN-based vision Transformers (ViTs) is hindered by two core issues: the violation of its temporal similarity prerequisite and a static architecture fundamentally unsuited for its principles. To address these challenges, we propose STAS (Spatio-Temporal Adaptive computation time for Spiking transformers), a framework that co-designs the static architecture and dynamic computation policy. STAS introduces an integrated spike patch splitting (I-SPS) module to establish temporal stability by creating a unified input representation, thereby solving the architectural problem of temporal dissimilarity. This stability, in turn, allows our adaptive spiking self-attention (A-SSA) module to perform two-dimensional token pruning across both spatial and temporal axes. Implemented on spiking Transformer architectures and validated on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet, STAS reduces energy consumption by up to 45.9%, 43.8%, and 30.1%, respectively, while simultaneously improving accuracy over SOTA models.</p></details> | 8 pages |

However, existing methods often suffer from imprecise sensor calibration, leading to feature misalignment in LiDAR-camera BEV fusion. Moreover, such inaccuracies cause errors in depth estimation for the camera branch, aggravating misalignment between LiDAR and camera BEV features. In this work, we propose a novel ContrastAlign approach that utilizes contrastive learning to enhance the alignment of heterogeneous modalities, thereby improving the robustness of the fusion process. Specifically, our approach comprises three key components: (1) the L-Instance module, which extracts LiDAR instance features within the LiDAR BEV features; (2) the C-Instance module, which predicts camera instance features through Region of Interest (RoI) pooling on the camera BEV features; (3) the InstanceFusion module, which employs contrastive learning to generate consistent instance features across heFterogeneous modalities. Subsequently, we use graph matching to calculate the similarity between the neighboring camera instance features and the similarity instance features to complete the alignment of instance features. Our method achieves SOTA performance, with an mAP of 71.5%, surpassing GraphBEV by 1.4% on the nuScenes val set. Importantly, our method excels BEVFusion under conditions with spatial & temporal misalignment noise, improving mAP by 1.4% and 11.1% on nuScenes dataset. Notably, on the Argoverse2 dataset, ContrastAlign outperforms GraphBEV by 1.0% in mAP, indicating that the farther the distance, the more severe the feature misalignment and the more effective.</p></details> | 12 pages, 3 figures |
| **[ROVER: Robust Loop Closure Verification with Trajectory Prior in Repetitive Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13488v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Loop closure detection is important for simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), which associates current observations with historical keyframes, achieving drift correction and global relocalization. However, a falsely detected loop can be fatal, and this is especially difficult in repetitive environments where appearance-based features fail due to the high similarity. Therefore, verification of a loop closure is a critical step in avoiding false positive detections. Existing works in loop closure verification predominantly focus on learning invariant appearance features, neglecting the prior knowledge of the robot's spatial-temporal motion cue, i.e., trajectory. In this letter, we propose ROVER, a loop closure verification method that leverages the historical trajectory as a prior constraint to reject false loops in challenging repetitive environments. For each loop candidate, it is first used to estimate the robot trajectory with pose-graph optimization. This trajectory is then submitted to a scoring scheme that assesses its compliance with the trajectory without the loop, which we refer to as the trajectory prior, to determine if the loop candidate should be accepted. Benchmark comparisons and real-world experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Furthermore, we integrate ROVER into state-of-the-art SLAM systems to verify its robustness and efficiency. Our source code and self-collected dataset are available at https://github.com/jarvisyjw/ROVER.</p></details> | 8 pages, 9 figures |

We propose STPFormer, a Spatio-Temporal Pattern-Aware Transformer that achieves state-of-the-art performance via unified and interpretable representation learning. It integrates four modules: Temporal Position Aggregator (TPA) for pattern-aware temporal encoding, Spatial Sequence Aggregator (SSA) for sequential spatial learning, Spatial-Temporal Graph Matching (STGM) for cross-domain alignment, and an Attention Mixer for multi-scale fusion. Experiments on five real-world datasets show that STPFormer consistently sets new SOTA results, with ablation and visualizations confirming its effectiveness and generalizability.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Maximum Coverage Model and Recommendation System for UAV Vertiports Location Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12651v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As urban aerial mobility (UAM) infrastructure development accelerates globally, cities like Shenzhen are planning large-scale vertiport networks (e.g., 1,200+ facilities by 2026). Existing planning frameworks remain inadequate for this complexity due to historical limitations in data granularity and real-world applicability. This paper addresses these gaps by first proposing the Capacitated Dynamic Maximum Covering Location Problem (CDMCLP), a novel optimization framework that simultaneously models urban-scale spatial-temporal demand, heterogeneous user behaviors, and infrastructure capacity constraints. Building on this foundation, we introduce an Integrated Planning Recommendation System that combines CDMCLP with socio-economic factors and dynamic clustering initialization. This system leverages adaptive parameter tuning based on empirical user behavior to generate practical planning solutions. Validation in a Chinese center city demonstrates the effectiveness of the new optimization framework and recommendation system. Under the evaluation and optimization of CDMCLP, the quantitative performance of traditional location methods are exposed and can be improved by 38\%--52\%, while the recommendation system shows user-friendliness and the effective integration of complex elements. By integrating mathematical rigor with practical implementation considerations, this hybrid approach bridges the gap between theoretical location modeling and real-world UAM infrastructure planning, offering municipalities a pragmatic tool for vertiport network design.</p></details> | 10 pages |

However, their potential for spatial modeling in multivariate time-series forecasting remains largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce a brand new SNN architecture, which is among the first to seamlessly integrate graph structural learning with spike-based temporal processing for multivariate time-series forecasting. Specifically, we first embed time features and an adaptive matrix, eliminating the need for predefined graph structures. We then further learn sequence features through the Observation (OBS) Block. Building upon this, our Multi-Scale Spike Aggregation (MSSA) hierarchically aggregates neighborhood information through spiking SAGE layers, enabling multi-hop feature extraction while eliminating the need for floating-point operations. Finally, we propose a Dual-Path Spike Fusion (DSF) Block to integrate spatial graph features and temporal dynamics via a spike-gated mechanism, combining LSTM-processed sequences with spiking self-attention outputs, effectively improve the model accuracy of long sequence datasets. Experiments show that our model surpasses the state-of-the-art SNN-based iSpikformer on all datasets and outperforms traditional temporal models at long horizons, thereby establishing a new paradigm for efficient spatial-temporal modeling.</p></details> | 9 pages, 4 figures |

While existing models excel at predicting human movement patterns, it remains unobvious how much they can interpret the underlying reasons or semantic meaning of those patterns. MobQA provides a comprehensive evaluation framework for LLMs to answer questions about diverse human GPS trajectories spanning daily to weekly granularities. It comprises 5,800 high-quality question-answer pairs across three complementary question types: factual retrieval (precise data extraction), multiple-choice reasoning (semantic inference), and free-form explanation (interpretive description), which all require spatial, temporal, and semantic reasoning. Our evaluation of major LLMs reveals strong performance on factual retrieval but significant limitations in semantic reasoning and explanation question answering, with trajectory length substantially impacting model effectiveness. These findings demonstrate the achievements and limitations of state-of-the-art LLMs for semantic mobility understanding.\footnote{MobQA dataset is available at https://github.com/CyberAgentAILab/mobqa.}</p></details> | 23 pages, 12 figures |
