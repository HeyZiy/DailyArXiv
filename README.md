| **[Time Series Forecastability Measures](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.13556v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes using two metrics to quantify the forecastability of time series prior to model development: the spectral predictability score and the largest Lyapunov exponent. Unlike traditional model evaluation metrics, these measures assess the inherent forecastability characteristics of the data before any forecast attempts. The spectral predictability score evaluates the strength and regularity of frequency components in the time series, whereas the Lyapunov exponents quantify the chaos and stability of the system generating the data. We evaluated the effectiveness of these metrics on both synthetic and real-world time series from the M5 forecast competition dataset. Our results demonstrate that these two metrics can correctly reflect the inherent forecastability of a time series and have a strong correlation with the actual forecast performance of various models. By understanding the inherent forecastability of time series before model training, practitioners can focus their planning efforts on products and supply chain levels that are more forecastable, while setting appropriate expectations or seeking alternative strategies for products with limited forecastability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Monash Time Series Forecasting Archive](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.06643v1)** | 2021-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many businesses and industries nowadays rely on large quantities of time series data making time series forecasting an important research area. Global forecasting models that are trained across sets of time series have shown a huge potential in providing accurate forecasts compared with the traditional univariate forecasting models that work on isolated series. However, there are currently no comprehensive time series archives for forecasting that contain datasets of time series from similar sources available for the research community to evaluate the performance of new global forecasting algorithms over a wide variety of datasets. In this paper, we present such a comprehensive time series forecasting archive containing 20 publicly available time series datasets from varied domains, with different characteristics in terms of frequency, series lengths, and inclusion of missing values. We also characterise the datasets, and identify similarities and differences among them, by conducting a feature analysis. Furthermore, we present the performance of a set of standard baseline forecasting methods over all datasets across eight error metrics, for the benefit of researchers using the archive to benchmark their forecasting algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>33 pa...</summary><p>33 pages, 3 figures, 15 tables</p></details> |
| **[Forecasting with time series imaging](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.08064v3)** | 2020-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Feature-based time series representations have attracted substantial attention in a wide range of time series analysis methods. Recently, the use of time series features for forecast model averaging has been an emerging research focus in the forecasting community. Nonetheless, most of the existing approaches depend on the manual choice of an appropriate set of features. Exploiting machine learning methods to extract features from time series automatically becomes crucial in state-of-the-art time series analysis. In this paper, we introduce an automated approach to extract time series features based on time series imaging. We first transform time series into recurrence plots, from which local features can be extracted using computer vision algorithms. The extracted features are used for forecast model averaging. Our experiments show that forecasting based on automatically extracted features, with less human intervention and a more comprehensive view of the raw time series data, yields highly comparable performances with the best methods in the largest forecasting competition dataset (M4) and outperforms the top methods in the Tourism forecasting competition dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[Retrieval Augmented Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.08249v1)** | 2024-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a central component of modern LLM systems, particularly in scenarios where up-to-date information is crucial for accurately responding to user queries or when queries exceed the scope of the training data. The advent of time-series foundation models (TSFM), such as Chronos, and the need for effective zero-shot forecasting performance across various time-series domains motivates the question: Do benefits of RAG similarly carry over to time series forecasting? In this paper, we advocate that the dynamic and event-driven nature of time-series data makes RAG a crucial component of TSFMs and introduce a principled RAG framework for time-series forecasting, called Retrieval Augmented Forecasting (RAF). Within RAF, we develop efficient strategies for retrieving related time-series examples and incorporating them into forecast. Through experiments and mechanistic studies, we demonstrate that RAF indeed improves the forecasting accuracy across diverse time series domains and the improvement is more significant for larger TSFM sizes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scaling Law for Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.15124v4)** | 2024-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scaling law that rewards large datasets, complex models and enhanced data granularity has been observed in various fields of deep learning. Yet, studies on time series forecasting have cast doubt on scaling behaviors of deep learning methods for time series forecasting: while more training data improves performance, more capable models do not always outperform less capable models, and longer input horizons may hurt performance for some models. We propose a theory for scaling law for time series forecasting that can explain these seemingly abnormal behaviors. We take into account the impact of dataset size and model complexity, as well as time series data granularity, particularly focusing on the look-back horizon, an aspect that has been unexplored in previous theories. Furthermore, we empirically evaluate various models using a diverse set of time series forecasting datasets, which (1) verifies the validity of scaling law on dataset size and model complexity within the realm of time series forecasting, and (2) validates our theoretical framework, particularly regarding the influence of look back horizon. We hope our findings may inspire new models targeting time series forecasting datasets of limited size, as well as large foundational datasets and models for time series forecasting in future work. Code for our experiments has been made public at https://github.com/JingzheShi/ScalingLawForTimeSeriesForecasting.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |
| **[Retrieval Based Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.13525v1)** | 2022-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series data appears in a variety of applications such as smart transportation and environmental monitoring. One of the fundamental problems for time series analysis is time series forecasting. Despite the success of recent deep time series forecasting methods, they require sufficient observation of historical values to make accurate forecasting. In other words, the ratio of the output length (or forecasting horizon) to the sum of the input and output lengths should be low enough (e.g., 0.3). As the ratio increases (e.g., to 0.8), the uncertainty for the forecasting accuracy increases significantly. In this paper, we show both theoretically and empirically that the uncertainty could be effectively reduced by retrieving relevant time series as references. In the theoretical analysis, we first quantify the uncertainty and show its connections to the Mean Squared Error (MSE). Then we prove that models with references are easier to learn than models without references since the retrieved references could reduce the uncertainty. To empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of the retrieval based time series forecasting models, we introduce a simple yet effective two-stage method, called ReTime consisting of a relational retrieval and a content synthesis. We also show that ReTime can be easily adapted to the spatial-temporal time series and time series imputation settings. Finally, we evaluate ReTime on real-world datasets to demonstrate its effectiveness.</p></details> | CIKM'22 AMLTS |
| **[Inter Time Series Sales Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1303.0117v1)** | 2013-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Combining forecast from different models has shown to perform better than single forecast in most time series. To improve the quality of forecast we can go for combining forecast. We study the effect of decomposing a series into multiple components and performing forecasts on each component separately... The original series is decomposed into trend, seasonality and an irregular component for each series. The statistical methods such as ARIMA, Holt-Winter have been used to forecast these components. In this paper we focus on how the best models of one series can be applied to similar frequency pattern series for forecasting using association mining. The proposed method forecast values has been compared with Holt Winter method and shown that the results are better than Holt Winter method</p></details> |  |
| **[Respecting Time Series Properties Makes Deep Time Series Forecasting Perfect](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.10941v1)** | 2022-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>How to handle time features shall be the core question of any time series forecasting model. Ironically, it is often ignored or misunderstood by deep-learning based models, even those baselines which are state-of-the-art. This behavior makes their inefficient, untenable and unstable. In this paper, we rigorously analyze three prevalent but deficient/unfounded deep time series forecasting mechanisms or methods from the view of time series properties, including normalization methods, multivariate forecasting and input sequence length. Corresponding corollaries and solutions are given on both empirical and theoretical basis. We thereby propose a novel time series forecasting network, i.e. RTNet, on the basis of aforementioned analysis. It is general enough to be combined with both supervised and self-supervised forecasting format. Thanks to the core idea of respecting time series properties, no matter in which forecasting format, RTNet shows obviously superior forecasting performances compared with dozens of other SOTA time series forecasting baselines in three real-world benchmark datasets. By and large, it even occupies less time complexity and memory usage while acquiring better forecasting accuracy. The source code is available at https://github.com/OrigamiSL/RTNet.</p></details> |  |
| **[Time-series Scenario Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1211.3010v1)** | 2012-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many applications require the ability to judge uncertainty of time-series forecasts. Uncertainty is often specified as point-wise error bars around a mean or median forecast. Due to temporal dependencies, such a method obscures some information. We would ideally have a way to query the posterior probability of the entire time-series given the predictive variables, or at a minimum, be able to draw samples from this distribution. We use a Bayesian dictionary learning algorithm to statistically generate an ensemble of forecasts. We show that the algorithm performs as well as a physics-based ensemble method for temperature forecasts for Houston. We conclude that the method shows promise for scenario forecasting where physics-based methods are absent.</p></details> | 16 pages |
| **[Series Saliency: Temporal Interpretation for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.09324v1)** | 2020-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting is an important yet challenging task. Though deep learning methods have recently been developed to give superior forecasting results, it is crucial to improve the interpretability of time series models. Previous interpretation methods, including the methods for general neural networks and attention-based methods, mainly consider the interpretation in the feature dimension while ignoring the crucial temporal dimension. In this paper, we present the series saliency framework for temporal interpretation for multivariate time series forecasting, which considers the forecasting interpretation in both feature and temporal dimensions. By extracting the "series images" from the sliding windows of the time series, we apply the saliency map segmentation following the smallest destroying region principle. The series saliency framework can be employed to any well-defined deep learning models and works as a data augmentation to get more accurate forecasts. Experimental results on several real datasets demonstrate that our framework generates temporal interpretations for the time series forecasting task while produces accurate time series forecast.</p></details> |  |
| **[EasyTime: Time Series Forecasting Made Easy](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.17603v1)** | 2024-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting has important applications across diverse domains. EasyTime, the system we demonstrate, facilitates easy use of time-series forecasting methods by researchers and practitioners alike. First, EasyTime enables one-click evaluation, enabling researchers to evaluate new forecasting methods using the suite of diverse time series datasets collected in the preexisting time series forecasting benchmark (TFB). This is achieved by leveraging TFB's flexible and consistent evaluation pipeline. Second, when practitioners must perform forecasting on a new dataset, a nontrivial first step is often to find an appropriate forecasting method. EasyTime provides an Automated Ensemble module that combines the promising forecasting methods to yield superior forecasting accuracy compared to individual methods. Third, EasyTime offers a natural language Q&A module leveraging large language models. Given a question like "Which method is best for long term forecasting on time series with strong seasonality?", EasyTime converts the question into SQL queries on the database of results obtained by TFB and then returns an answer in natural language and charts. By demonstrating EasyTime, we intend to show how it is possible to simplify the use of time series forecasting and to offer better support for the development of new generations of time series forecasting methods.</p></details> | Accepted by ICDE2025 |
| **[An Introductory Study on Time Series Modeling and Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1302.6613v1)** | 2013-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series modeling and forecasting has fundamental importance to various practical domains. Thus a lot of active research works is going on in this subject during several years. Many important models have been proposed in literature for improving the accuracy and effectiveness of time series forecasting. The aim of this dissertation work is to present a concise description of some popular time series forecasting models used in practice, with their salient features. In this thesis, we have described three important classes of time series models, viz. the stochastic, neural networks and SVM based models, together with their inherent forecasting strengths and weaknesses. We have also discussed about the basic issues related to time series modeling, such as stationarity, parsimony, overfitting, etc. Our discussion about different time series models is supported by giving the experimental forecast results, performed on six real time series datasets. While fitting a model to a dataset, special care is taken to select the most parsimonious one. To evaluate forecast accuracy as well as to compare among different models fitted to a time series, we have used the five performance measures, viz. MSE, MAD, RMSE, MAPE and Theil's U-statistics. For each of the six datasets, we have shown the obtained forecast diagram which graphically depicts the closeness between the original and forecasted observations. To have authenticity as well as clarity in our discussion about time series modeling and forecasting, we have taken the help of various published research works from reputed journals and some standard books.</p></details> | <details><summary>67 pa...</summary><p>67 pages, 29 figures, 33 references, book</p></details> |
| **[Forecasting time series with constraints](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.10485v1)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting presents unique challenges that limit the effectiveness of traditional machine learning algorithms. To address these limitations, various approaches have incorporated linear constraints into learning algorithms, such as generalized additive models and hierarchical forecasting. In this paper, we propose a unified framework for integrating and combining linear constraints in time series forecasting. Within this framework, we show that the exact minimizer of the constrained empirical risk can be computed efficiently using linear algebra alone. This approach allows for highly scalable implementations optimized for GPUs. We validate the proposed methodology through extensive benchmarking on real-world tasks, including electricity demand forecasting and tourism forecasting, achieving state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimal starting point for time series forecasting](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.16843v2)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances on time series forecasting mainly focus on improving the forecasting models themselves. However, when the time series data suffer from potential structural breaks or concept drifts, the forecasting performance might be significantly reduced. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach called Optimal Starting Point Time Series Forecast (OSP-TSP) for optimal forecasting, which can be combined with existing time series forecasting models. By adjusting the sequence length via leveraging the XGBoost and LightGBM models, the proposed approach can determine the optimal starting point (OSP) of the time series and then enhance the prediction performances of the base forecasting models. To illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, comprehensive empirical analysis have been conducted on the M4 dataset and other real world datasets. Empirical results indicate that predictions based on the OSP-TSP approach consistently outperform those using the complete time series dataset. Moreover, comparison results reveals that combining our approach with existing forecasting models can achieve better prediction accuracy, which also reflect the advantages of the proposed approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Few-shot Learning for Time-series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.14379v1)** | 2020-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time-series forecasting is important for many applications. Forecasting models are usually trained using time-series data in a specific target task. However, sufficient data in the target task might be unavailable, which leads to performance degradation. In this paper, we propose a few-shot learning method that forecasts a future value of a time-series in a target task given a few time-series in the target task. Our model is trained using time-series data in multiple training tasks that are different from target tasks. Our model uses a few time-series to build a forecasting function based on a recurrent neural network with an attention mechanism. With the attention mechanism, we can retrieve useful patterns in a small number of time-series for the current situation. Our model is trained by minimizing an expected test error of forecasting next timestep values. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method using 90 time-series datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Performative Time-Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.06077v2)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time-series forecasting is a critical challenge in various domains and has witnessed substantial progress in recent years. Many real-life scenarios, such as public health, economics, and social applications, involve feedback loops where predictions can influence the predicted outcome, subsequently altering the target variable's distribution. This phenomenon, known as performativity, introduces the potential for 'self-negating' or 'self-fulfilling' predictions. Despite extensive studies in classification problems across domains, performativity remains largely unexplored in the context of time-series forecasting from a machine-learning perspective. In this paper, we formalize performative time-series forecasting (PeTS), addressing the challenge of accurate predictions when performativity-induced distribution shifts are possible. We propose a novel approach, Feature Performative-Shifting (FPS), which leverages the concept of delayed response to anticipate distribution shifts and subsequently predicts targets accordingly. We provide theoretical insights suggesting that FPS can potentially lead to reduced generalization error. We conduct comprehensive experiments using multiple time-series models on COVID-19 and traffic forecasting tasks. The results demonstrate that FPS consistently outperforms conventional time-series forecasting methods, highlighting its efficacy in handling performativity-induced challenges.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages (8 main text, 1 reference, 3 appendix), 5 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[A robust functional time series forecasting method](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.06030v1)** | 2019-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Univariate time series often take the form of a collection of curves observed sequentially over time. Examples of these include hourly ground-level ozone concentration curves. These curves can be viewed as a time series of functions observed at equally spaced intervals over a dense grid. Since functional time series may contain various types of outliers, we introduce a robust functional time series forecasting method to down-weigh the influence of outliers in forecasting. Through a robust principal component analysis based on projection pursuit, a time series of functions can be decomposed into a set of robust dynamic functional principal components and their associated scores. Conditioning on the estimated functional principal components, the crux of the curve-forecasting problem lies in modeling and forecasting principal component scores, through a robust vector autoregressive forecasting method. Via a simulation study and an empirical study on forecasting ground-level ozone concentration, the robust method demonstrates the superior forecast accuracy that dynamic functional principal component regression entails. The robust method also shows the superior estimation accuracy of the parameters in the vector autoregressive models for modeling and forecasting principal component scores, and thus improves curve forecast accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 6 figures, 4 tables, to appear in Journal of Statistical Computation and Simulation</p></details> |
| **[Inter-Series Transformer: Attending to Products in Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.03872v1)** | 2024-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting is an important task in many fields ranging from supply chain management to weather forecasting. Recently, Transformer neural network architectures have shown promising results in forecasting on common time series benchmark datasets. However, application to supply chain demand forecasting, which can have challenging characteristics such as sparsity and cross-series effects, has been limited. In this work, we explore the application of Transformer-based models to supply chain demand forecasting. In particular, we develop a new Transformer-based forecasting approach using a shared, multi-task per-time series network with an initial component applying attention across time series, to capture interactions and help address sparsity. We provide a case study applying our approach to successfully improve demand prediction for a medical device manufacturing company. To further validate our approach, we also apply it to public demand forecasting datasets as well and demonstrate competitive to superior performance compared to a variety of baseline and state-of-the-art forecast methods across the private and public datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Empowering Time Series Forecasting with LLM-Agents](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.04231v1)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM) powered agents have emerged as effective planners for Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) systems. While most existing AutoML approaches focus on automating feature engineering and model architecture search, recent studies in time series forecasting suggest that lightweight models can often achieve state-of-the-art performance. This observation led us to explore improving data quality, rather than model architecture, as a potentially fruitful direction for AutoML on time series data. We propose DCATS, a Data-Centric Agent for Time Series. DCATS leverages metadata accompanying time series to clean data while optimizing forecasting performance. We evaluated DCATS using four time series forecasting models on a large-scale traffic volume forecasting dataset. Results demonstrate that DCATS achieves an average 6% error reduction across all tested models and time horizons, highlighting the potential of data-centric approaches in AutoML for time series forecasting.</p></details> |  |
| **[Counterfactual Explanations for Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.08137v1)** | 2023-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Among recent developments in time series forecasting methods, deep forecasting models have gained popularity as they can utilize hidden feature patterns in time series to improve forecasting performance. Nevertheless, the majority of current deep forecasting models are opaque, hence making it challenging to interpret the results. While counterfactual explanations have been extensively employed as a post-hoc approach for explaining classification models, their application to forecasting models still remains underexplored. In this paper, we formulate the novel problem of counterfactual generation for time series forecasting, and propose an algorithm, called ForecastCF, that solves the problem by applying gradient-based perturbations to the original time series. ForecastCF guides the perturbations by applying constraints to the forecasted values to obtain desired prediction outcomes. We experimentally evaluate ForecastCF using four state-of-the-art deep model architectures and compare to two baselines. Our results show that ForecastCF outperforms the baseline in terms of counterfactual validity and data manifold closeness. Overall, our findings suggest that ForecastCF can generate meaningful and relevant counterfactual explanations for various forecasting tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 6 figures.

| **[Deconfounding Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.21328v1)** | 2024-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting is a critical task in various domains, where accurate predictions can drive informed decision-making. Traditional forecasting methods often rely on current observations of variables to predict future outcomes, typically overlooking the influence of latent confounders, unobserved variables that simultaneously affect both the predictors and the target outcomes. This oversight can introduce bias and degrade the performance of predictive models. In this study, we address this challenge by proposing an enhanced forecasting approach that incorporates representations of latent confounders derived from historical data. By integrating these confounders into the predictive process, our method aims to improve the accuracy and robustness of time series forecasts. The proposed approach is demonstrated through its application to climate science data, showing significant improvements over traditional methods that do not account for confounders.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hierarchical Time Series Forecasting with Bayesian Modeling](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.14719v1)** | 2023-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We encounter time series data in many domains such as finance, physics, business, and weather. One of the main tasks of time series analysis, one that helps to take informed decisions under uncertainty, is forecasting. Time series are often hierarchically structured, e.g., a company sales might be broken down into different regions, and each region into different stores. In some cases the number of series in the hierarchy is too big to fit in a single model to produce forecasts in relevant time, and a decentralized approach is beneficial. One way to do this is to train independent forecasting models for each series and for some summary statistics series implied by the hierarchy (e.g. the sum of all series) and to pass those models to a reconciliation algorithm to improve those forecasts by sharing information between the series. In this work we focus on the reconciliation step, and propose a method to do so from a Bayesian perspective - Bayesian forecast reconciliation. We also define the common case of linear Gaussian reconciliation, where the forecasts are Gaussian and the hierarchy has linear structure, and show that we can compute reconciliation in closed form. We evaluate these methods on synthetic and real data sets, and compare them to other work in this field.</p></details> |  |
| **[A machine learning approach for forecasting hierarchical time series](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.00630v2)** | 2021-07-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose a machine learning approach for forecasting hierarchical time series. When dealing with hierarchical time series, apart from generating accurate forecasts, one needs to select a suitable method for producing reconciled forecasts. Forecast reconciliation is the process of adjusting forecasts to make them coherent across the hierarchy. In literature, coherence is often enforced by using a post-processing technique on the base forecasts produced by suitable time series forecasting methods. On the contrary, our idea is to use a deep neural network to directly produce accurate and reconciled forecasts. We exploit the ability of a deep neural network to extract information capturing the structure of the hierarchy. We impose the reconciliation at training time by minimizing a customized loss function. In many practical applications, besides time series data, hierarchical time series include explanatory variables that are beneficial for increasing the forecasting accuracy. Exploiting this further information, our approach links the relationship between time series features extracted at any level of the hierarchy and the explanatory variables into an end-to-end neural network providing accurate and reconciled point forecasts. The effectiveness of the approach is validated on three real-world datasets, where our method outperforms state-of-the-art competitors in hierarchical forecasting.</p></details> |  |
| **[Topological Attention for Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.09031v1)** | 2021-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The problem of (point) forecasting $ \textit{univariate} $ time series is considered. Most approaches, ranging from traditional statistical methods to recent learning-based techniques with neural networks, directly operate on raw time series observations. As an extension, we study whether $\textit{local topological properties}$, as captured via persistent homology, can serve as a reliable signal that provides complementary information for learning to forecast. To this end, we propose $\textit{topological attention}$, which allows attending to local topological features within a time horizon of historical data. Our approach easily integrates into existing end-to-end trainable forecasting models, such as $\texttt{N-BEATS}$, and in combination with the latter exhibits state-of-the-art performance on the large-scale M4 benchmark dataset of 100,000 diverse time series from different domains. Ablation experiments, as well as a comparison to a broad range of forecasting methods in a setting where only a single time series is available for training, corroborate the beneficial nature of including local topological information through an attention mechanism.</p></details> |  |
| **[auto-sktime: Automated Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.08528v3)** | 2024-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In today's data-driven landscape, time series forecasting is pivotal in decision-making across various sectors. Yet, the proliferation of more diverse time series data, coupled with the expanding landscape of available forecasting methods, poses significant challenges for forecasters. To meet the growing demand for efficient forecasting, we introduce auto-sktime, a novel framework for automated time series forecasting. The proposed framework uses the power of automated machine learning (AutoML) techniques to automate the creation of the entire forecasting pipeline. The framework employs Bayesian optimization, to automatically construct pipelines from statistical, machine learning (ML) and deep neural network (DNN) models. Furthermore, we propose three essential improvements to adapt AutoML to time series data. First, pipeline templates to account for the different supported forecasting models. Second, a novel warm-starting technique to start the optimization from prior optimization runs. Third, we adapt multi-fidelity optimizations to make them applicable to a search space containing statistical, ML and DNN models. Experimental results on 64 diverse real-world time series datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the framework, outperforming traditional methods while requiring minimal human involvement.</p></details> | Accepted at LION18 |
| **[Robust Probabilistic Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.11910v1)** | 2022-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Probabilistic time series forecasting has played critical role in decision-making processes due to its capability to quantify uncertainties. Deep forecasting models, however, could be prone to input perturbations, and the notion of such perturbations, together with that of robustness, has not even been completely established in the regime of probabilistic forecasting. In this work, we propose a framework for robust probabilistic time series forecasting. First, we generalize the concept of adversarial input perturbations, based on which we formulate the concept of robustness in terms of bounded Wasserstein deviation. Then we extend the randomized smoothing technique to attain robust probabilistic forecasters with theoretical robustness certificates against certain classes of adversarial perturbations. Lastly, extensive experiments demonstrate that our methods are empirically effective in enhancing the forecast quality under additive adversarial attacks and forecast consistency under supplement of noisy observations.</p></details> | <details><summary>AISTA...</summary><p>AISTATS 2022 camera ready version</p></details> |
| **[Differential Convolutional Fuzzy Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.08890v2)** | 2023-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fuzzy time series forecasting (FTSF) is a typical forecasting method with wide application. Traditional FTSF is regarded as an expert system which leads to loss of the ability to recognize undefined features. The mentioned is the main reason for poor forecasting with FTSF. To solve the problem, the proposed model Differential Fuzzy Convolutional Neural Network (DFCNN) utilizes a convolution neural network to re-implement FTSF with learnable ability. DFCNN is capable of recognizing potential information and improving forecasting accuracy. Thanks to the learnable ability of the neural network, the length of fuzzy rules established in FTSF is expended to an arbitrary length that the expert is not able to handle by the expert system. At the same time, FTSF usually cannot achieve satisfactory performance of non-stationary time series due to the trend of non-stationary time series. The trend of non-stationary time series causes the fuzzy set established by FTSF to be invalid and causes the forecasting to fail. DFCNN utilizes the Difference algorithm to weaken the non-stationary of time series so that DFCNN can forecast the non-stationary time series with a low error that FTSF cannot forecast in satisfactory performance. After the mass of experiments, DFCNN has an excellent prediction effect, which is ahead of the existing FTSF and common time series forecasting algorithms. Finally, DFCNN provides further ideas for improving FTSF and holds continued research value.</p></details> |  |

In today's data-rich environment, people often aim to choose the optimal forecasting model for their data. However, identifying the optimal model requires professional knowledge and experience, making accurate forecasting a challenging task. To mitigate the importance of model selection, we propose a simple and reliable algorithm to improve the forecasting performance. Specifically, we construct multiple time series with different sub-seasons from the original time series. These derived series highlight different sub-seasonal patterns of the original series, making it possible for the forecasting methods to capture diverse patterns and components of the data. Subsequently, we produce forecasts for these multiple series separately with classical statistical models (ETS or ARIMA). Finally, the forecasts are combined. We evaluate our approach on widely-used forecasting competition data sets (M1, M3, and M4) in terms of both point forecasts and prediction intervals. We observe performance improvements compared with the benchmarks. Our approach is particularly suitable and robust for the data with higher frequency. To demonstrate the practical value of our proposition, we showcase the performance improvements from our approach on hourly load data that exhibit multiple seasonal patterns.</p></details> |  |
| **[Boosted Embeddings for Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.04781v2)** | 2021-07-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting is a fundamental task emerging from diverse data-driven applications. Many advanced autoregressive methods such as ARIMA were used to develop forecasting models. Recently, deep learning based methods such as DeepAr, NeuralProphet, Seq2Seq have been explored for time series forecasting problem. In this paper, we propose a novel time series forecast model, DeepGB. We formulate and implement a variant of Gradient boosting wherein the weak learners are DNNs whose weights are incrementally found in a greedy manner over iterations. In particular, we develop a new embedding architecture that improves the performance of many deep learning models on time series using Gradient boosting variant. We demonstrate that our model outperforms existing comparable state-of-the-art models using real-world sensor data and public dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Predictive Approach To Enhance Time-Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.15217v3)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate time-series forecasting is crucial in various scientific and industrial domains, yet deep learning models often struggle to capture long-term dependencies and adapt to data distribution shifts over time. We introduce Future-Guided Learning, an approach that enhances time-series event forecasting through a dynamic feedback mechanism inspired by predictive coding. Our method involves two models: a detection model that analyzes future data to identify critical events and a forecasting model that predicts these events based on current data. When discrepancies occur between the forecasting and detection models, a more significant update is applied to the forecasting model, effectively minimizing surprise, allowing the forecasting model to dynamically adjust its parameters. We validate our approach on a variety of tasks, demonstrating a 44.8% increase in AUC-ROC for seizure prediction using EEG data, and a 23.4% reduction in MSE for forecasting in nonlinear dynamical systems (outlier excluded).By incorporating a predictive feedback mechanism, Future-Guided Learning advances how deep learning is applied to time-series forecasting.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cross-Frequency Time Series Meta-Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.02077v1)** | 2023-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Meta-forecasting is a newly emerging field which combines meta-learning and time series forecasting. The goal of meta-forecasting is to train over a collection of source time series and generalize to new time series one-at-a-time. Previous approaches in meta-forecasting achieve competitive performance, but with the restriction of training a separate model for each sampling frequency. In this work, we investigate meta-forecasting over different sampling frequencies, and introduce a new model, the Continuous Frequency Adapter (CFA), specifically designed to learn frequency-invariant representations. We find that CFA greatly improves performance when generalizing to unseen frequencies, providing a first step towards forecasting over larger multi-frequency datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Review of automated time series forecasting pipelines](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.01712v1)** | 2022-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting is fundamental for various use cases in different domains such as energy systems and economics. Creating a forecasting model for a specific use case requires an iterative and complex design process. The typical design process includes the five sections (1) data pre-processing, (2) feature engineering, (3) hyperparameter optimization, (4) forecasting method selection, and (5) forecast ensembling, which are commonly organized in a pipeline structure. One promising approach to handle the ever-growing demand for time series forecasts is automating this design process. The present paper, thus, analyzes the existing literature on automated time series forecasting pipelines to investigate how to automate the design process of forecasting models. Thereby, we consider both Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) and automated statistical forecasting methods in a single forecasting pipeline. For this purpose, we firstly present and compare the proposed automation methods for each pipeline section. Secondly, we analyze the automation methods regarding their interaction, combination, and coverage of the five pipeline sections. For both, we discuss the literature, identify problems, give recommendations, and suggest future research. This review reveals that the majority of papers only cover two or three of the five pipeline sections. We conclude that future research has to holistically consider the automation of the forecasting pipeline to enable the large-scale application of time series forecasting.</p></details> |  |

But are language models actually useful for time series? In a series of ablation studies on three recent and popular LLM-based time series forecasting methods, we find that removing the LLM component or replacing it with a basic attention layer does not degrade forecasting performance -- in most cases, the results even improve! We also find that despite their significant computational cost, pretrained LLMs do no better than models trained from scratch, do not represent the sequential dependencies in time series, and do not assist in few-shot settings. Additionally, we explore time series encoders and find that patching and attention structures perform similarly to LLM-based forecasters.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2024 (Spotlight)</p></details> |
| **[Metadata Matters for Time Series: Informative Forecasting with Transformers](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.03806v1)** | 2024-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting is prevalent in extensive real-world applications, such as financial analysis and energy planning. Previous studies primarily focus on time series modality, endeavoring to capture the intricate variations and dependencies inherent in time series. Beyond numerical time series data, we notice that metadata (e.g.~dataset and variate descriptions) also carries valuable information essential for forecasting, which can be used to identify the application scenario and provide more interpretable knowledge than digit sequences. Inspired by this observation, we propose a Metadata-informed Time Series Transformer (MetaTST), which incorporates multiple levels of context-specific metadata into Transformer forecasting models to enable informative time series forecasting. To tackle the unstructured nature of metadata, MetaTST formalizes them into natural languages by pre-designed templates and leverages large language models (LLMs) to encode these texts into metadata tokens as a supplement to classic series tokens, resulting in an informative embedding. Further, a Transformer encoder is employed to communicate series and metadata tokens, which can extend series representations by metadata information for more accurate forecasting. This design also allows the model to adaptively learn context-specific patterns across various scenarios, which is particularly effective in handling large-scale, diverse-scenario forecasting tasks. Experimentally, MetaTST achieves state-of-the-art compared to advanced time series models and LLM-based methods on widely acknowledged short- and long-term forecasting benchmarks, covering both single-dataset individual and multi-dataset joint training settings.</p></details> |  |

Due to different properties of each time series such as length, obtaining forecasts for each individual time series in a straight-forward way is challenging. This paper proposes a general framework utilizing a similarity measure in Dynamic Time Warping to find similar time series to build neighborhoods in a k-Nearest Neighbor fashion, and improve forecasts of possibly simple models by averaging. Several ways of performing the averaging are suggested, and theoretical arguments underline the usefulness of averaging for forecasting. Additionally, diagnostics tools are proposed allowing a deep understanding of the procedure.</p></details> |  |

| **[Can time series forecasting be automated? A benchmark and analysis](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.16445v2)** | 2024-07-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the field of machine learning and artificial intelligence, time series forecasting plays a pivotal role across various domains such as finance, healthcare, and weather. However, the task of selecting the most suitable forecasting method for a given dataset is a complex task due to the diversity of data patterns and characteristics. This research aims to address this challenge by proposing a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating and ranking time series forecasting methods across a wide range of datasets. This study investigates the comparative performance of many methods from two prominent time series forecasting frameworks, AutoGluon-Timeseries, and sktime to shed light on their applicability in different real-world scenarios. This research contributes to the field of time series forecasting by providing a robust benchmarking methodology and facilitating informed decision-making when choosing forecasting methods for achieving optimal prediction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hybrid Variational Autoencoder for Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.07048v1)** | 2023-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Variational autoencoders (VAE) are powerful generative models that learn the latent representations of input data as random variables. Recent studies show that VAE can flexibly learn the complex temporal dynamics of time series and achieve more promising forecasting results than deterministic models. However, a major limitation of existing works is that they fail to jointly learn the local patterns (e.g., seasonality and trend) and temporal dynamics of time series for forecasting. Accordingly, we propose a novel hybrid variational autoencoder (HyVAE) to integrate the learning of local patterns and temporal dynamics by variational inference for time series forecasting. Experimental results on four real-world datasets show that the proposed HyVAE achieves better forecasting results than various counterpart methods, as well as two HyVAE variants that only learn the local patterns or temporal dynamics of time series, respectively.</p></details> |  |

This fusion of information creates a comprehensive representation, which is then processed through a linear layer to generate the final forecast.

| **[Graph Deep Learning for Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.15978v2)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph deep learning methods have become popular tools to process collections of correlated time series. Unlike traditional multivariate forecasting methods, graph-based predictors leverage pairwise relationships by conditioning forecasts on graphs spanning the time series collection. The conditioning takes the form of architectural inductive biases on the forecasting architecture, resulting in a family of models called spatiotemporal graph neural networks. These biases allow for training global forecasting models on large collections of time series while localizing predictions w.r.t. each element in the set (nodes) by accounting for correlations among them (edges). Recent advances in graph neural networks and deep learning for time series forecasting make the adoption of such processing framework appealing and timely. However, most studies focus on refining existing architectures by exploiting modern deep-learning practices. Conversely, foundational and methodological aspects have not been subject to systematic investigation. To fill this void, this tutorial paper aims to introduce a comprehensive methodological framework formalizing the forecasting problem and providing design principles for graph-based predictors, as well as methods to assess their performance. In addition, together with an overview of the field, we provide design guidelines and best practices, as well as an in-depth discussion of open challenges and future directions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a tutorial paper in ACM Computing Surveys</p></details> |
| **[Application of data compression techniques to time series forecasting](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.03825v1)** | 2019-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this study we show that standard well-known file compression programs (zlib, bzip2, etc.) are able to forecast real-world time series data well. The strength of our approach is its ability to use a set of data compression algorithms and "automatically" choose the best one of them during the process of forecasting. Besides, modern data-compressors are able to find many kinds of latent regularities using some methods of artificial intelligence (for example, some data-compressors are based on finding the smallest formal grammar that describes the time series). Thus, our approach makes it possible to apply some particular methods of artificial intelligence for time-series forecasting. As examples of the application of the proposed method, we made forecasts for the monthly T-index and the Kp-index time series using standard compressors. In both cases, we used the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) as an accuracy measure. For the monthly T-index time series, we made 18 forecasts beyond the available data for each month since January 2011 to July 2017. We show that, in comparison with the forecasts made by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology, our method more accurately predicts one value ahead. The Kp-index time series consists of 3-hour values ranging from 0 to 9. For each day from February 4, 2018 to March 28, 2018, we made forecasts for 24 values ahead. We compared our forecasts with the forecasts made by the Space Weather Prediction Center (SWPC). The results showed that the accuracy of our method is similar to the accuracy of the SWPC's method. As in the previous case, we also obtained more accurate one-step forecasts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted.

We used an ensemble of five statistical forecasting methods and a method that we refer to as the correlator. Our retrospective analysis using the ground truth values published by the M4 organisers after the competition demonstrates that the correlator was responsible for most of our gains over the naive constant forecasting method. We identify data leakage as one reason for its success, partly due to test data selected from different time intervals, and partly due to quality issues in the original time series. We suggest that future forecasting competitions should provide actual dates for the time series so that some of those leakages could be avoided by the participants.</p></details> |  |
| **[Two-Stage Framework for Seasonal Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.02144v1)** | 2021-06-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Seasonal time series Forecasting remains a challenging problem due to the long-term dependency from seasonality. In this paper, we propose a two-stage framework to forecast univariate seasonal time series. The first stage explicitly learns the long-range time series structure in a time window beyond the forecast horizon. By incorporating the learned long-range structure, the second stage can enhance the prediction accuracy in the forecast horizon. In both stages, we integrate the auto-regressive model with neural networks to capture both linear and non-linear characteristics in time series. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on M4 Competition Hourly datasets. In particular, we show that incorporating the intermediate results generated in the first stage to existing forecast models can effectively enhance their prediction performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 2 figures, 3 tables, ICASSP 2021</p></details> |

Most time series of interest are macroscopic time series that are aggregated from microscopic data. However, instead of directly modeling the macroscopic time series, rare literature studied the forecasting of macroscopic time series by leveraging data on the microscopic level. In this paper, we assume that the microscopic time series follow some unknown mixture probabilistic distributions. We theoretically show that as we identify the ground truth latent mixture components, the estimation of time series from each component could be improved because of lower variance, thus benefitting the estimation of macroscopic time series as well. Inspired by the power of Seq2seq and its variants on the modeling of time series data, we propose Mixture of Seq2seq (MixSeq), an end2end mixture model to cluster microscopic time series, where all the components come from a family of Seq2seq models parameterized by different parameters. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world data show the superiority of our approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 2 figures, NeurIPS 2021</p></details> |
| **[Unified Training of Universal Time Series Forecasting Transformers](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.02592v2)** | 2024-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning for time series forecasting has traditionally operated within a one-model-per-dataset framework, limiting its potential to leverage the game-changing impact of large pre-trained models. The concept of universal forecasting, emerging from pre-training on a vast collection of time series datasets, envisions a single Large Time Series Model capable of addressing diverse downstream forecasting tasks. However, constructing such a model poses unique challenges specific to time series data: i) cross-frequency learning, ii) accommodating an arbitrary number of variates for multivariate time series, and iii) addressing the varying distributional properties inherent in large-scale data. To address these challenges, we present novel enhancements to the conventional time series Transformer architecture, resulting in our proposed Masked Encoder-based Universal Time Series Forecasting Transformer (Moirai). Trained on our newly introduced Large-scale Open Time Series Archive (LOTSA) featuring over 27B observations across nine domains, Moirai achieves competitive or superior performance as a zero-shot forecaster when compared to full-shot models.

| **[Hierarchical Time Series Forecasting with Robust Reconciliation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.20383v1)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper focuses on forecasting hierarchical time-series data, where each higher-level observation equals the sum of its corresponding lower-level time series. In such contexts, the forecast values should be coherent, meaning that the forecast value of each parent series exactly matches the sum of the forecast values of its child series. Existing hierarchical forecasting methods typically generate base forecasts independently for each series and then apply a reconciliation procedure to adjust them so that the resulting forecast values are coherent across the hierarchy. These methods generally derive an optimal reconciliation, using a covariance matrix of the forecast error. In practice, however, the true covariance matrix is unknown and has to be estimated from finite samples in advance. This gap between the true and estimated covariance matrix may degrade forecast performance. To address this issue, we propose a robust optimization framework for hierarchical reconciliation that accounts for uncertainty in the estimated covariance matrix. We first introduce an uncertainty set for the estimated covariance matrix and formulate a reconciliation problem that minimizes the worst-case expected squared error over this uncertainty set. We show that our problem can be cast as a semidefinite optimization problem. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed robust reconciliation method achieved better forecast performance than existing hierarchical forecasting methods, which indicates the effectiveness of integrating uncertainty into the reconciliation process.</p></details> |  |
| **[Linguistic Approach to Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.00985v1)** | 2022-07-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes methods of predicting dynamic time series (including non-stationary ones) based on a linguistic approach, namely, the study of occurrences and repetition of so-called N-grams. This approach is used in computational linguistics to create statistical translators, detect plagiarism and duplicate documents. However, the scope of application can be extended beyond linguistics by taking into account the correlations of sequences of stable word combinations, as well as trends. The proposed methods do not require a preliminary study and determination of the characteristics of time series or complex tuning of the input parameters of the forecasting model. They allow, with a high level of automation, to carry out short-term and medium-term forecasts of time series, characterized by trends and cyclicality, in particular, series of publication dynamics in content monitoring systems. Also, the proposed methods can be used to predict the values of the parameters of a large complex system with the aim of monitoring its state, when the number of such parameters is significant, and therefore a high level of automation of the forecasting process is desirable. A significant advantage of the approach is the absence of requirements for time series stationarity and a small number of tuning parameters. Further research may focus on the study of various criteria for the similarity of time series fragments, the use of nonlinear similarity criteria, the search for ways to automatically determine the rational step of quantization of the time series.</p></details> | 8 pages, 9 figures |

In this paper, we propose RAFT, a retrieval-augmented time series forecasting method to provide sufficient inductive biases and complement the model's learning capacity. When forecasting the subsequent time frames, we directly retrieve historical data candidates from the training dataset with patterns most similar to the input, and utilize the future values of these candidates alongside the inputs to obtain predictions. This simple approach augments the model's capacity by externally providing information about past patterns via retrieval modules. Our empirical evaluations on ten benchmark datasets show that RAFT consistently outperforms contemporary baselines with an average win ratio of 86%.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we present MoTime, a suite of multimodal time series forecasting datasets that pair temporal signals with external modalities such as text, metadata, and images. Covering diverse domains, MoTime supports structured evaluation of modality utility under two scenarios: 1) the common forecasting task, where varying-length history is available, and 2) cold-start forecasting, where no historical data is available. Experiments show that external modalities can improve forecasting performance in both scenarios, with particularly strong benefits for short series in some datasets, though the impact varies depending on data characteristics. By making datasets and findings publicly available, we aim to support more comprehensive and realistic benchmarks in future multimodal time series forecasting research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Probabilistic Decomposition Transformer for Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.17393v1)** | 2022-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting is crucial for many fields, such as disaster warning, weather prediction, and energy consumption. The Transformer-based models are considered to have revolutionized the field of sequence modeling. However, the complex temporal patterns of the time series hinder the model from mining reliable temporal dependencies. Furthermore, the autoregressive form of the Transformer introduces cumulative errors in the inference step. In this paper, we propose the probabilistic decomposition Transformer model that combines the Transformer with a conditional generative model, which provides hierarchical and interpretable probabilistic forecasts for intricate time series. The Transformer is employed to learn temporal patterns and implement primary probabilistic forecasts, while the conditional generative model is used to achieve non-autoregressive hierarchical probabilistic forecasts by introducing latent space feature representations. In addition, the conditional generative model reconstructs typical features of the series, such as seasonality and trend terms, from probability distributions in the latent space to enable complex pattern separation and provide interpretable forecasts. Extensive experiments on several datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed model, indicating that it compares favorably with the state of the art.</p></details> |  |
| **[Drift-Adjusted And Arbitrated Ensemble Framework For Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.09311v1)** | 2020-03-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time Series Forecasting is at the core of many practical applications such as sales forecasting for business, rainfall forecasting for agriculture and many others. Though this problem has been extensively studied for years, it is still considered a challenging problem due to complex and evolving nature of time series data. Typical methods proposed for time series forecasting modeled linear or non-linear dependencies between data observations. However it is a generally accepted notion that no one method is universally effective for all kinds of time series data. Attempts have been made to use dynamic and weighted combination of heterogeneous and independent forecasting models and it has been found to be a promising direction to tackle this problem. This method is based on the assumption that different forecasters have different specialization and varying performance for different distribution of data and weights are dynamically assigned to multiple forecasters accordingly. However in many practical time series data-set, the distribution of data slowly evolves with time. We propose to employ a re-weighting based method to adjust the assigned weights to various forecasters in order to account for such distribution-drift. An exhaustive testing was performed against both real-world and synthesized time-series. Experimental results show the competitiveness of the method in comparison to state-of-the-art approaches for combining forecasters and handling drift.</p></details> |  |

Such drifts expose the forecasting models to out-of-distribution (OOD) data, and machine learning models lack robustness in these settings. Robustness can be improved by using deep generative models or genetic algorithms to augment time series datasets, but these approaches lack interpretability and are computationally expensive. In this work, we develop an interpretable and simple framework for generating time series. Our method combines time-series decompositions with analytic functions, and is able to generate time series with characteristics matching both in- and out-of-distribution data. This approach allows users to generate new time series in an interpretable fashion, which can be used to augment the dataset and improve forecasting robustness. We demonstrate our framework through EXPRTS, a visual analytics tool designed for univariate time series forecasting models and datasets. Different visualizations of the data distribution, forecasting errors and single time series instances enable users to explore time series datasets, apply transformations, and evaluate forecasting model robustness across diverse scenarios. We show how our framework can generate meaningful OOD time series that improve model robustness, and we validate EXPRTS effectiveness and usability through three use-cases and a user study.</p></details> | under review |
| **[Global Models for Time Series Forecasting: A Simulation Study](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.12485v3)** | 2021-03-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the current context of Big Data, the nature of many forecasting problems has changed from predicting isolated time series to predicting many time series from similar sources. This has opened up the opportunity to develop competitive global forecasting models that simultaneously learn from many time series. But, it still remains unclear when global forecasting models can outperform the univariate benchmarks, especially along the dimensions of the homogeneity/heterogeneity of series, the complexity of patterns in the series, the complexity of forecasting models, and the lengths/number of series. Our study attempts to address this problem through investigating the effect from these factors, by simulating a number of datasets that have controllable time series characteristics. Specifically, we simulate time series from simple data generating processes (DGP), such as Auto Regressive (AR) and Seasonal AR, to complex DGPs, such as Chaotic Logistic Map, Self-Exciting Threshold Auto-Regressive, and Mackey-Glass Equations. The data heterogeneity is introduced by mixing time series generated from several DGPs into a single dataset. The lengths and the number of series in the dataset are varied in different scenarios. We perform experiments on these datasets using global forecasting models including Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), Feed-Forward Neural Networks, Pooled Regression (PR) models and Light Gradient Boosting Models (LGBM), and compare their performance against standard statistical univariate forecasting techniques. Our experiments demonstrate that when trained as global forecasting models, techniques such as RNNs and LGBMs, which have complex non-linear modelling capabilities, are competitive methods in general under challenging forecasting scenarios such as series having short lengths, datasets with heterogeneous series and having minimal prior knowledge of the patterns of the series.</p></details> |  |
| **[Simple Contrastive Representation Learning for Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.18205v2)** | 2024-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contrastive learning methods have shown an impressive ability to learn meaningful representations for image or time series classification. However, these methods are less effective for time series forecasting, as optimization of instance discrimination is not directly applicable to predicting the future state from the historical context. To address these limitations, we propose SimTS, a simple representation learning approach for improving time series forecasting by learning to predict the future from the past in the latent space. SimTS exclusively uses positive pairs and does not depend on negative pairs or specific characteristics of a given time series. In addition, we show the shortcomings of the current contrastive learning framework used for time series forecasting through a detailed ablation study. Overall, our work suggests that SimTS is a promising alternative to other contrastive learning approaches for time series forecasting.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extended version.

The coordinates of the centers of clusters have been put in correspondence with summarizing time series data the centroids of the clusters. A description of time series, the centroids of the clusters, is implemented with the use of forecasting models. They are based on strict binary trees and a modified clonal selection algorithm. With the help of such forecasting models, the possibility of forming analytic dependences is shown. It is suggested to use a common forecasting model, which is constructed for time series the centroid of the cluster, in forecasting the private (individual) time series in the cluster. The promising application of the suggested method for grouped time series forecasting is demonstrated.</p></details> | 18 pages |
| **[Attention as Robust Representation for Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.05370v1)** | 2024-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting is essential for many practical applications, with the adoption of transformer-based models on the rise due to their impressive performance in NLP and CV. Transformers' key feature, the attention mechanism, dynamically fusing embeddings to enhance data representation, often relegating attention weights to a byproduct role. Yet, time series data, characterized by noise and non-stationarity, poses significant forecasting challenges. Our approach elevates attention weights as the primary representation for time series, capitalizing on the temporal relationships among data points to improve forecasting accuracy. Our study shows that an attention map, structured using global landmarks and local windows, acts as a robust kernel representation for data points, withstanding noise and shifts in distribution. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art models, reducing mean squared error (MSE) in multivariate time series forecasting by a notable 3.6% without altering the core neural network architecture. It serves as a versatile component that can readily replace recent patching based embedding schemes in transformer-based models, boosting their performance.</p></details> |  |

Novel univariate models synthesise dynamic generalized linear models for binary and conditionally Poisson time series, with dynamic random effects for over-dispersion. These models allow use of dynamic covariates in both binary and non-zero count components. Sequential Bayesian analysis allows fast, parallel analysis of sets of decoupled time series. New multivariate models then enable information sharing in contexts when data at a more highly aggregated level provide more incisive inferences on shared patterns such as trends and seasonality. A novel multi-scale approach-- one new example of the concept of decouple/recouple in time series-- enables information sharing across series. This incorporates cross-series linkages while insulating parallel estimation of univariate models, hence enables scalability in the number of series. The major motivating context is supermarket sales forecasting. Detailed examples drawn from a case study in multi-step forecasting of sales of a number of related items showcase forecasting of multiple series, with discussion of forecast accuracy metrics and broader questions of probabilistic forecast accuracy assessment.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 10 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

To develop an automated way of online time series forecasting, we propose a Theoretical framework for Online Time-series forecasting (TOT in short) with theoretical guarantees. Specifically, we prove that supplying a forecaster with latent variables tightens the Bayes risk, the benefit endures under estimation uncertainty of latent variables and grows as the latent variables achieve a more precise identifiability. To better introduce latent variables into online forecasting algorithms, we further propose to identify latent variables with minimal adjacent observations. Based on these results, we devise a model-agnostic blueprint by employing a temporal decoder to match the distribution of observed variables and two independent noise estimators to model the causal inference of latent variables and mixing procedures of observed variables, respectively. Experiment results on synthetic data support our theoretical claims. Moreover, plug-in implementations built on several baselines yield general improvement across multiple benchmarks, highlighting the effectiveness in real-world applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Task Time Series Forecasting With Shared Attention](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.09645v1)** | 2021-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting is a key component in many industrial and business decision processes and recurrent neural network (RNN) based models have achieved impressive progress on various time series forecasting tasks. However, most of the existing methods focus on single-task forecasting problems by learning separately based on limited supervised objectives, which often suffer from insufficient training instances. As the Transformer architecture and other attention-based models have demonstrated its great capability of capturing long term dependency, we propose two self-attention based sharing schemes for multi-task time series forecasting which can train jointly across multiple tasks. We augment a sequence of paralleled Transformer encoders with an external public multi-head attention function, which is updated by all data of all tasks. Experiments on a number of real-world multi-task time series forecasting tasks show that our proposed architectures can not only outperform the state-of-the-art single-task forecasting baselines but also outperform the RNN-based multi-task forecasting method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICDMW 2020</p></details> |

Time series data are prevalent in many scientific and engineering disciplines. Time series forecasting is a crucial task in modeling time series data, and is an important area of machine learning. In this work we developed a novel method that employs Transformer-based machine learning models to forecast time series data. This approach works by leveraging self-attention mechanisms to learn complex patterns and dynamics from time series data. Moreover, it is a generic framework and can be applied to univariate and multivariate time series data, as well as time series embeddings. Using influenza-like illness (ILI) forecasting as a case study, we show that the forecasting results produced by our approach are favorably comparable to the state-of-the-art.</p></details> | 10 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Time Series Forecasting Using Manifold Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.03625v4)** | 2023-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We address a three-tier numerical framework based on manifold learning for the forecasting of high-dimensional time series. At the first step, we embed the time series into a reduced low-dimensional space using a nonlinear manifold learning algorithm such as Locally Linear Embedding and Diffusion Maps. At the second step, we construct reduced-order regression models on the manifold, in particular Multivariate Autoregressive (MVAR) and Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) models, to forecast the embedded dynamics. At the final step, we lift the embedded time series back to the original high-dimensional space using Radial Basis Functions interpolation and Geometric Harmonics. For our illustrations, we test the forecasting performance of the proposed numerical scheme with four sets of time series: three synthetic stochastic ones resembling EEG signals produced from linear and nonlinear stochastic models with different model orders, and one real-world data set containing daily time series of 10 key foreign exchange rates (FOREX) spanning the time period 03/09/2001-29/10/2020. The forecasting performance of the proposed numerical scheme is assessed using the combinations of manifold learning, modelling and lifting approaches. We also provide a comparison with the Principal Component Analysis algorithm as well as with the naive random walk model and the MVAR and GPR models trained and implemented directly in the high-dimensional space.</p></details> |  |

| **[Accuracy Law for the Future of Deep Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.02729v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep time series forecasting has emerged as a booming direction in recent years. Despite the exponential growth of community interests, researchers are sometimes confused about the direction of their efforts due to minor improvements on standard benchmarks. In this paper, we notice that, unlike image recognition, whose well-acknowledged and realizable goal is 100% accuracy, time series forecasting inherently faces a non-zero error lower bound due to its partially observable and uncertain nature. To pinpoint the research objective and release researchers from saturated tasks, this paper focuses on a fundamental question: how to estimate the performance upper bound of deep time series forecasting? Going beyond classical series-wise predictability metrics, e.g., ADF test, we realize that the forecasting performance is highly related to window-wise properties because of the sequence-to-sequence forecasting paradigm of deep time series models. Based on rigorous statistical tests of over 2,800 newly trained deep forecasters, we discover a significant exponential relationship between the minimum forecasting error of deep models and the complexity of window-wise series patterns, which is termed the accuracy law. The proposed accuracy law successfully guides us to identify saturated tasks from widely used benchmarks and derives an effective training strategy for large time series models, offering valuable insights for future research.</p></details> |  |

| **[FrAug: Frequency Domain Augmentation for Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.09292v1)** | 2023-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data augmentation (DA) has become a de facto solution to expand training data size for deep learning. With the proliferation of deep models for time series analysis, various time series DA techniques are proposed in the literature, e.g., cropping-, warping-, flipping-, and mixup-based methods. However, these augmentation methods mainly apply to time series classification and anomaly detection tasks. In time series forecasting (TSF), we need to model the fine-grained temporal relationship within time series segments to generate accurate forecasting results given data in a look-back window. Existing DA solutions in the time domain would break such a relationship, leading to poor forecasting accuracy. To tackle this problem, this paper proposes simple yet effective frequency domain augmentation techniques that ensure the semantic consistency of augmented data-label pairs in forecasting, named FrAug. We conduct extensive experiments on eight widely-used benchmarks with several state-of-the-art TSF deep models. Our results show that FrAug can boost the forecasting accuracy of TSF models in most cases. Moreover, we show that FrAug enables models trained with 1\% of the original training data to achieve similar performance to the ones trained on full training data, which is particularly attractive for cold-start forecasting. Finally, we show that applying test-time training with FrAug greatly improves forecasting accuracy for time series with significant distribution shifts, which often occurs in real-life TSF applications.

| **[Test Time Learning for Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.14012v3)** | 2024-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time-series forecasting has seen significant advancements with the introduction of token prediction mechanisms such as multi-head attention. However, these methods often struggle to achieve the same performance as in language modeling, primarily due to the quadratic computational cost and the complexity of capturing long-range dependencies in time-series data. State-space models (SSMs), such as Mamba, have shown promise in addressing these challenges by offering efficient solutions with linear RNNs capable of modeling long sequences with larger context windows. However, there remains room for improvement in accuracy and scalability. We propose the use of Test-Time Training (TTT) modules in a parallel architecture to enhance performance in long-term time series forecasting. Through extensive experiments on standard benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that TTT modules consistently outperform state-of-the-art models, including the Mamba-based TimeMachine, particularly in scenarios involving extended sequence and prediction lengths. Our results show significant improvements in Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE), especially on larger datasets such as Electricity, Traffic, and Weather, underscoring the effectiveness of TTT in capturing long-range dependencies. Additionally, we explore various convolutional architectures within the TTT framework, showing that even simple configurations like 1D convolution with small filters can achieve competitive results. This work sets a new benchmark for time-series forecasting and lays the groundwork for future research in scalable, high-performance forecasting models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cross-LKTCN: Modern Convolution Utilizing Cross-Variable Dependency for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting Dependency for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.02326v1)** | 2023-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The past few years have witnessed the rapid development in multivariate time series forecasting. The key to accurate forecasting results is capturing the long-term dependency between each time step (cross-time dependency) and modeling the complex dependency between each variable (cross-variable dependency) in multivariate time series. However, recent methods mainly focus on the cross-time dependency but seldom consider the cross-variable dependency. To fill this gap, we find that convolution, a traditional technique but recently losing steam in time series forecasting, meets the needs of respectively capturing the cross-time and cross-variable dependency. Based on this finding, we propose a modern pure convolution structure, namely Cross-LKTCN, to better utilize both cross-time and cross-variable dependency for time series forecasting. Specifically in each Cross-LKTCN block, a depth-wise large kernel convolution with large receptive field is proposed to capture cross-time dependency, and then two successive point-wise group convolution feed forward networks are proposed to capture cross-variable dependency. Experimental results on real-world benchmarks show that Cross-LKTCN achieves state-of-the-art forecasting performance and improves the forecasting accuracy significantly compared with existing convolutional-based models and cross-variable methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[ETSformer: Exponential Smoothing Transformers for Time-series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.01381v2)** | 2022-06-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformers have been actively studied for time-series forecasting in recent years. While often showing promising results in various scenarios, traditional Transformers are not designed to fully exploit the characteristics of time-series data and thus suffer some fundamental limitations, e.g., they generally lack of decomposition capability and interpretability, and are neither effective nor efficient for long-term forecasting. In this paper, we propose ETSFormer, a novel time-series Transformer architecture, which exploits the principle of exponential smoothing in improving Transformers for time-series forecasting. In particular, inspired by the classical exponential smoothing methods in time-series forecasting, we propose the novel exponential smoothing attention (ESA) and frequency attention (FA) to replace the self-attention mechanism in vanilla Transformers, thus improving both accuracy and efficiency. Based on these, we redesign the Transformer architecture with modular decomposition blocks such that it can learn to decompose the time-series data into interpretable time-series components such as level, growth and seasonality. Extensive experiments on various time-series benchmarks validate the efficacy and advantages of the proposed method. Code is available at https://github.com/salesforce/ETSformer.</p></details> |  |

Our method first estimates parameters for each univariate time series. Next, we use these parameters to cluster the time series. These clusters can be viewed as multivariate time series, for which we then compute parameters. The forecasted values of a single time series can depend on the history of other time series in the same cluster, accounting for intra-cluster similarity while minimizing potential noise in predictions by ignoring inter-cluster effects. Our framework -- which we refer to as "cluster-and-conquer" -- is highly general, allowing for any time-series forecasting and clustering method to be used in each step. It is computationally efficient and embarrassingly parallel. We motivate our framework with a theoretical analysis in an idealized mixed linear regression setting, where we provide guarantees on the quality of the estimates. We accompany these guarantees with experimental results that demonstrate the advantages of our framework: when instantiated with simple linear autoregressive models, we are able to achieve state-of-the-art results on several benchmark datasets, sometimes outperforming deep-learning-based approaches.</p></details> | 25 pages, 3 figures |

As a classic machine learning task, time series forecasting has recently been boosted by LLMs. Recent works treat large language models as \emph{zero-shot} time series reasoners without further fine-tuning, which achieves remarkable performance. However, there are some unexplored research problems when applying LLMs for time series forecasting under the zero-shot setting. For instance, the LLMs' preferences for the input time series are less understood. In this paper, by comparing LLMs with traditional time series forecasting models, we observe many interesting properties of LLMs in the context of time series forecasting. First, our study shows that LLMs perform well in predicting time series with clear patterns and trends, but face challenges with datasets lacking periodicity. This observation can be explained by the ability of LLMs to recognize the underlying period within datasets, which is supported by our experiments. In addition, the input strategy is investigated, and it is found that incorporating external knowledge and adopting natural language paraphrases substantially improve the predictive performance of LLMs for time series. Overall, our study contributes insight into LLMs' advantages and limitations in time series forecasting under different conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by SIGKDD Explorations Newsletter</p></details> |

However, it remains unclear whether their success stems from a true understanding of temporal dynamics or simply from memorizing the training data. While implicit reasoning in language models has been studied, similar evaluations for time series models have been largely unexplored. This work takes an initial step toward assessing the reasoning abilities of deep time series forecasting models. We find that certain linear, MLP-based, and patch-based Transformer models generalize effectively in systematically orchestrated out-of-distribution scenarios, suggesting underexplored reasoning capabilities beyond simple pattern memorization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Attention-Based Ensemble Pooling for Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.16231v1)** | 2023-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A common technique to reduce model bias in time-series forecasting is to use an ensemble of predictive models and pool their output into an ensemble forecast. In cases where each predictive model has different biases, however, it is not always clear exactly how each model forecast should be weighed during this pooling. We propose a method for pooling that performs a weighted average over candidate model forecasts, where the weights are learned by an attention-based ensemble pooling model. We test this method on two time-series forecasting problems: multi-step forecasting of the dynamics of the non-stationary Lorenz `63 equation, and one-step forecasting of the weekly incident deaths due to COVID-19. We find that while our model achieves excellent valid times when forecasting the non-stationary Lorenz `63 equation, it does not consistently perform better than the existing ensemble pooling when forecasting COVID-19 weekly incident deaths.</p></details> | 9 pages, 5 figures |

To measure the potential severity of this problem, we derive theoretical bounds for the loss to forecasts from additive exponential smoothing models using protected data. Following the guidelines of anonymization from the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), we develop the $k$-nearest Time Series ($k$-nTS) Swapping and $k$-means Time Series ($k$-mTS) Shuffling methods to create protected time series data that minimizes the loss to forecasts while preventing a data intruder from detecting privacy issues. For efficient and effective decision making, we formally model an integer programming problem for a perfect matching for simultaneous data swapping in each cluster. We call it a two-party data privacy framework since our optimization model includes the utilities of a data provider and data intruder. We apply our data protection methods to thousands of time series and find that it maintains the forecasts and patterns (level, trend, and seasonality) of time series well compared to standard data protection methods suggested in legislation. Substantively, our paper addresses the challenge of protecting time series data when used for forecasting. Our findings suggest the managerial importance of incorporating the concerns of forecasters into the data protection itself.</p></details> | found better results |

Unlike classical forecasting models, the proposed approach does not assume any parametric form for the predictive distribution and instead generates predictions by sampling from the empirical distribution according to a tunable strategy. By virtue of this, the model is always able to produce reasonable forecasts (i.e., predictions within the observed data range) without fail unlike classical models that suffer from numerical stability on some data distributions. Moreover, we develop a global version of the proposed method that automatically learns the sampling strategy by exploiting the information across multiple related time series. The empirical evaluation shows that the proposed methods have reasonable and consistent performance across all datasets, proving them to be strong baselines to be considered in one's forecasting toolbox.</p></details> |  |
| **[Measuring Time Series Forecast Stability for Demand Planning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.10063v1)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting is a critical first step in generating demand plans for supply chains. Experiments on time series models typically focus on demonstrating improvements in forecast accuracy over existing/baseline solutions, quantified according to some accuracy metric. There is no doubt that forecast accuracy is important; however in production systems, demand planners often value consistency and stability over incremental accuracy improvements. Assuming that the inputs have not changed significantly, forecasts that vary drastically from one planning cycle to the next require high amounts of human intervention, which frustrates demand planners and can even cause them to lose trust in ML forecasting models. We study model-induced stochasticity, which quantifies the variance of a set of forecasts produced by a single model when the set of inputs is fixed. Models with lower variance are more stable. Recently the forecasting community has seen significant advances in forecast accuracy through the development of deep machine learning models for time series forecasting. We perform a case study measuring the stability and accuracy of state-of-the-art forecasting models (Chronos, DeepAR, PatchTST, Temporal Fusion Transformer, TiDE, and the AutoGluon best quality ensemble) on public data sets from the M5 competition and Favorita grocery sales. We show that ensemble models improve stability without significantly deteriorating (or even improving) forecast accuracy. While these results may not be surprising, the main point of this paper is to propose the need for further study of forecast stability for models that are being deployed in production systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 3 figures; KDD '25</p></details> |

The proposed network contains stacks of dilated convolutions that allow it to access a broad range of history when forecasting, a ReLU activation function and conditioning is performed by applying multiple convolutional filters in parallel to separate time series which allows for the fast processing of data and the exploitation of the correlation structure between the multivariate time series. We test and analyze the performance of the convolutional network both unconditionally as well as conditionally for financial time series forecasting using the S&P500, the volatility index, the CBOE interest rate and several exchange rates and extensively compare it to the performance of the well-known autoregressive model and a long-short term memory network. We show that a convolutional network is well-suited for regression-type problems and is able to effectively learn dependencies in and between the series without the need for long historical time series, is a time-efficient and easy to implement alternative to recurrent-type networks and tends to outperform linear and recurrent models.</p></details> |  |

These problems result in forecasts that often misalign with human intuition. To tackle these challenges, we propose an adversarial learning framework with a deep analysis of adversarial components. Specifically, we emphasize the importance of balancing the modeling of global distribution (overall patterns) and transition dynamics (localized temporal changes) to better capture the nuances of irregular time series. Overall, this research provides practical insights for improving models and evaluation metrics, and pioneers the application of adversarial learning in the domian of irregular time-series forecasting.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AdvML-Frontiers Workshop @ NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |

Recent works model the relations between time-series as graphs and have shown that propagating information over the relation graph can improve time series forecasting. However, in many cases, relational information is not available or is noisy and reliable. Moreover, most works ignore the underlying uncertainty of time-series both for structure learning and deriving the forecasts resulting in the structure not capturing the uncertainty resulting in forecast distributions with poor uncertainty estimates. We tackle this challenge and introduce STOIC, that leverages stochastic correlations between time-series to learn underlying structure between time-series and to provide well-calibrated and accurate forecasts. Over a wide-range of benchmark datasets STOIC provides around 16% more accurate and 14% better-calibrated forecasts. STOIC also shows better adaptation to noise in data during inference and captures important and useful relational information in various benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Time-Prompt: Integrated Heterogeneous Prompts for Unlocking LLMs in Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.17631v3)** | 2025-11-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting aims to model temporal dependencies among variables for future state inference, holding significant importance and widespread applications in real-world scenarios. Although deep learning-based methods have achieved remarkable progress, they still exhibit suboptimal performance in long-term forecasting. Recent research demonstrates that large language models (LLMs) achieve promising performance in time series forecasting, but this progress is still met with skepticism about whether LLMs are truly useful for this task. To address this, we propose Time-Prompt, a framework for activating LLMs for time series forecasting. Specifically, we first construct a unified prompt paradigm with learnable soft prompts to guide the LLM's behavior and textualized hard prompts to enhance the time series representations. Second, to enhance LLM' comprehensive understanding of the forecasting task, we design a semantic space embedding and cross-modal alignment module to achieve fusion of temporal and textual data. Finally, we efficiently fine-tune the LLM's parameters using time series data. Furthermore, we focus on carbon emissions, aiming to provide a modest contribution to global carbon neutrality. Comprehensive evaluations on 6 public datasets and 3 carbon emission datasets demonstrate that Time-Prompt is a powerful framework for time series forecasting.</p></details> |  |
| **[Two-Step Meta-Learning for Time-Series Forecasting Ensemble](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.10545v2)** | 2022-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Amounts of historical data collected increase and business intelligence applicability with automatic forecasting of time series are in high demand. While no single time series modeling method is universal to all types of dynamics, forecasting using an ensemble of several methods is often seen as a compromise. Instead of fixing ensemble diversity and size, we propose to predict these aspects adaptively using meta-learning. Meta-learning here considers two separate random forest regression models, built on 390 time-series features, to rank 22 univariate forecasting methods and recommend ensemble size. The forecasting ensemble is consequently formed from methods ranked as the best, and forecasts are pooled using either simple or weighted average (with a weight corresponding to reciprocal rank). The proposed approach was tested on 12561 micro-economic time-series (expanded to 38633 for various forecasting horizons) of M4 competition where meta-learning outperformed Theta and Comb benchmarks by relative forecasting errors for all data types and horizons. Best overall results were achieved by weighted pooling with a symmetric mean absolute percentage error of 9.21% versus 11.05% obtained using the Theta method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE Access journal in April 22, 2021</p></details> |

The forecasting performance of different methods changes depending on the nature of the time series. When forecasting large collections of time series, two lines of approaches have been developed using time series features, namely feature-based model selection and feature-based model combination.

| **[Forecasting Irregularly Sampled Time Series using Graphs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.12932v2)** | 2023-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Forecasting irregularly sampled time series with missing values is a crucial task for numerous real-world applications such as healthcare, astronomy, and climate sciences. State-of-the-art approaches to this problem rely on Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) which are known to be slow and often require additional features to handle missing values. To address this issue, we propose a novel model using Graphs for Forecasting Irregularly Sampled Time Series with missing values which we call GraFITi. GraFITi first converts the time series to a Sparsity Structure Graph which is a sparse bipartite graph, and then reformulates the forecasting problem as the edge weight prediction task in the graph. It uses the power of Graph Neural Networks to learn the graph and predict the target edge weights. GraFITi has been tested on 3 real-world and 1 synthetic irregularly sampled time series dataset with missing values and compared with various state-of-the-art models. The experimental results demonstrate that GraFITi improves the forecasting accuracy by up to 17% and reduces the run time up to 5 times compared to the state-of-the-art forecasting models.</p></details> |  |

However, applying SNNs to time-series forecasting is challenging due to difficulties in effective temporal alignment, complexities in encoding processes, and the absence of standardized guidelines for model selection. In this paper, we propose a framework for SNNs in time-series forecasting tasks, leveraging the efficiency of spiking neurons in processing temporal information. Through a series of experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed SNN-based approaches achieve comparable or superior results to traditional time-series forecasting methods on diverse benchmarks with much less energy consumption. Furthermore, we conduct detailed analysis experiments to assess the SNN's capacity to capture temporal dependencies within time-series data, offering valuable insights into its nuanced strengths and effectiveness in modeling the intricate dynamics of temporal data. Our study contributes to the expanding field of SNNs and offers a promising alternative for time-series forecasting tasks, presenting a pathway for the development of more biologically inspired and temporally aware forecasting models.

Recent studies have shown that analyzing and forecasting of functional time series can be performed easily using functional principal component analysis and existing univariate/multivariate time series models. However, the forecasting performance of such functional time series models may be affected by the presence of outlying observations which are very common in many scientific fields. Outliers may distort the functional time series model structure, and thus, the underlying model may produce high forecast errors. We introduce a robust forecasting technique based on weighted likelihood methodology to obtain point and interval forecasts in functional time series in the presence of outliers. The finite sample performance of the proposed method is illustrated by Monte Carlo simulations and four real-data examples. Numerical results reveal that the proposed method exhibits superior performance compared with the existing method(s).</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 4 figures, to appear in Journal of Statistical Computation and Simulation</p></details> |

OFTER utilizes the non-parametric models of k-nearest neighbors and Generalized Regression Neural Networks, integrated with a dimensionality reduction component. To circumvent the curse of dimensionality, we employ a weighted norm based on a modified version of the maximal correlation coefficient. The pipeline we introduce is specifically designed for online tasks, has an interpretable output, and is able to outperform several state-of-the art baselines. The computational efficacy of the algorithm, its online nature, and its ability to operate in low signal-to-noise regimes, render OFTER an ideal approach for financial multivariate time series problems, such as daily equity forecasting. Our work demonstrates that while deep learning models hold significant promise for time series forecasting, traditional methods carefully integrating mainstream tools remain very competitive alternatives with the added benefits of scalability and interpretability.</p></details> | 26 pages, 12 figures |
| **[Tackling Data Heterogeneity in Federated Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.15716v1)** | 2024-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting plays a critical role in various real-world applications, including energy consumption prediction, disease transmission monitoring, and weather forecasting. Although substantial progress has been made in time series forecasting, most existing methods rely on a centralized training paradigm, where large amounts of data are collected from distributed devices (e.g., sensors, wearables) to a central cloud server. However, this paradigm has overloaded communication networks and raised privacy concerns. Federated learning, a popular privacy-preserving technique, enables collaborative model training across distributed data sources. However, directly applying federated learning to time series forecasting often yields suboptimal results, as time series data generated by different devices are inherently heterogeneous. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, Fed-TREND, to address data heterogeneity by generating informative synthetic data as auxiliary knowledge carriers. Specifically, Fed-TREND generates two types of synthetic data. The first type of synthetic data captures the representative distribution information from clients' uploaded model updates and enhances clients' local training consensus. The second kind of synthetic data extracts long-term influence insights from global model update trajectories and is used to refine the global model after aggregation. Fed-TREND is compatible with most time series forecasting models and can be seamlessly integrated into existing federated learning frameworks to improve prediction performance. Extensive experiments on eight datasets, using several federated learning baselines and four popular time series forecasting models, demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of Fed-TREND.</p></details> |  |
| **[A novel weighted approach for time series forecasting based on visibility graph](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.13870v6)** | 2022-08-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series has attracted a lot of attention in many fields today. Time series forecasting algorithm based on complex network analysis is a research hotspot. How to use time series information to achieve more accurate forecasting is a problem. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a weighted network forecasting method to improve the forecasting accuracy. Firstly, the time series will be transformed into a complex network, and the similarity between nodes will be found. Then, the similarity will be used as a weight to make weighted forecasting on the predicted values produced by different nodes. Compared with the previous method, the proposed method is more accurate. In order to verify the effect of the proposed method, the experimental part is tested on M1, M3 datasets and Construction Cost Index (CCI) dataset, which shows that the proposed method has more accurate forecasting performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Deep Time-index Models for Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.06046v4)** | 2023-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning has been actively applied to time series forecasting, leading to a deluge of new methods, belonging to the class of historical-value models. Yet, despite the attractive properties of time-index models, such as being able to model the continuous nature of underlying time series dynamics, little attention has been given to them. Indeed, while naive deep time-index models are far more expressive than the manually predefined function representations of classical time-index models, they are inadequate for forecasting, being unable to generalize to unseen time steps due to the lack of inductive bias. In this paper, we propose DeepTime, a meta-optimization framework to learn deep time-index models which overcome these limitations, yielding an efficient and accurate forecasting model. Extensive experiments on real world datasets in the long sequence time-series forecasting setting demonstrate that our approach achieves competitive results with state-of-the-art methods, and is highly efficient.

| **[Combating Distribution Shift for Accurate Time Series Forecasting via Hypernetworks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.10808v2)** | 2022-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting has widespread applications in urban life ranging from air quality monitoring to traffic analysis. However, accurate time series forecasting is challenging because real-world time series suffer from the distribution shift problem, where their statistical properties change over time. Despite extensive solutions to distribution shifts in domain adaptation or generalization, they fail to function effectively in unknown, constantly-changing distribution shifts, which are common in time series. In this paper, we propose Hyper Time- Series Forecasting (HTSF), a hypernetwork-based framework for accurate time series forecasting under distribution shift. HTSF jointly learns the time-varying distributions and the corresponding forecasting models in an end-to-end fashion. Specifically, HTSF exploits the hyper layers to learn the best characterization of the distribution shifts, generating the model parameters for the main layers to make accurate predictions. We implement HTSF as an extensible framework that can incorporate diverse time series forecasting models such as RNNs and Transformers. Extensive experiments on 9 benchmarks demonstrate that HTSF achieves state-of-the-art performances.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures |

However, offline deep forecasting models fail to adapt effectively to changes in time-series data, while online deep forecasting models are often expensive and have complex training procedures. In this paper, we reframe the online nonlinear time-series forecasting problem as one of linear hyperdimensional time-series forecasting. Nonlinear low-dimensional time-series data is mapped to high-dimensional (hyperdimensional) spaces for linear hyperdimensional prediction, allowing fast, efficient and lightweight online time-series forecasting. Our framework, TSF-HD, adapts to time-series distribution shifts using a novel co-training framework for its hyperdimensional mapping and its linear hyperdimensional predictor. TSF-HD is shown to outperform the state of the art, while having reduced inference latency, for both short-term and long-term time series forecasting.

Traditional approaches in this area predict the future behavior of dynamical systems by inferring the evolution function. However, these methods may confront obstacles due to the presence of missing variables, which are usually attributed to challenges in measurement and a partial understanding of the system of interest. To overcome this obstacle, we introduce the autoregressive with slack time series (ARS) model, that simultaneously estimates the evolution function and imputes missing variables as a slack time series. Assuming time-invariance and linearity in the (underlying) entire dynamical time series, our experiments demonstrate the ARS model's capability to forecast future time series. From a theoretical perspective, we prove that a 2-dimensional time-invariant and linear system can be reconstructed by utilizing observations from a single, partially observed dimension of the system.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 6 figures, accepted to IEEE Access</p></details> |

| **[Evaluation of Traffic Signals for Daily Traffic Pattern](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.21469v1)** | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The turning movement count data is crucial for traffic signal design, intersection geometry planning, traffic flow, and congestion analysis. This work proposes three methods called dynamic, static, and hybrid configuration for TMC-based traffic signals. A vision-based tracking system is developed to estimate the TMC of six intersections in Las Vegas using traffic cameras. The intersection design, route (e.g. vehicle movement directions), and signal configuration files with compatible formats are synthesized and imported into Simulation of Urban MObility for signal evaluation with realistic data. The initial experimental results based on estimated waiting times indicate that the cycle time of 90 and 120 seconds works best for all intersections. In addition, four intersections show better performance for dynamic signal timing configuration, and the other two with lower performance have a lower ratio of total vehicle count to total lanes of the intersection leg. Since daily traffic flow often exhibits a bimodal pattern, we propose a hybrid signal method that switches between dynamic and static methods, adapting to peak and off-peak traffic conditions for improved flow management. So, a built-in traffic generator module creates vehicle routes for 4 hours, including peak hours, and a signal design module produces signal schedule cycles according to static, dynamic, and hybrid methods. Vehicle count distributions are weighted differently for each zone (i.e., West, North, East, South) to generate diverse traffic patterns. The extended experimental results for 6 intersections with 4 hours of simulation time imply that zone-based traffic pattern distributions affect signal design selection. Although the static method works great for evenly zone-based traffic distribution, the hybrid method works well for highly weighted traffic at intersection pairs of the West-East and North-South zones.</p></details> |  |
| **[Traffic-Aware Autonomous Driving with Differentiable Traffic Simulation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.03772v5)** | 2023-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While there have been advancements in autonomous driving control and traffic simulation, there have been little to no works exploring their unification with deep learning. Works in both areas seem to focus on entirely different exclusive problems, yet traffic and driving are inherently related in the real world. In this paper, we present Traffic-Aware Autonomous Driving (TrAAD), a generalizable distillation-style method for traffic-informed imitation learning that directly optimizes for faster traffic flow and lower energy consumption. TrAAD focuses on the supervision of speed control in imitation learning systems, as most driving research focuses on perception and steering. Moreover, our method addresses the lack of co-simulation between traffic and driving simulators and provides a basis for directly involving traffic simulation with autonomous driving in future work. Our results show that, with information from traffic simulation involved in the supervision of imitation learning methods, an autonomous vehicle can learn how to accelerate in a fashion that is beneficial for traffic flow and overall energy consumption for all nearby vehicles.</p></details> |  |
| **[Defining Traffic States using Spatio-temporal Traffic Graphs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.00827v1)** | 2020-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Intersections are one of the main sources of congestion and hence, it is important to understand traffic behavior at intersections. Particularly, in developing countries with high vehicle density, mixed traffic type, and lane-less driving behavior, it is difficult to distinguish between congested and normal traffic behavior. In this work, we propose a way to understand the traffic state of smaller spatial regions at intersections using traffic graphs. The way these traffic graphs evolve over time reveals different traffic states - a) a congestion is forming (clumping), the congestion is dispersing (unclumping), or c) the traffic is flowing normally (neutral). We train a spatio-temporal deep network to identify these changes. Also, we introduce a large dataset called EyeonTraffic (EoT) containing 3 hours of aerial videos collected at 3 busy intersections in Ahmedabad, India. Our experiments on the EoT dataset show that the traffic graphs can help in correctly identifying congestion-prone behavior in different spatial regions of an intersection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in 23rd IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems September 20 to 23, 2020. 6 pages, 6 figures</p></details> |
| **[Turning Traffic Monitoring Cameras into Intelligent Sensors for Traffic Density Estimation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.00941v1)** | 2021-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate traffic state information plays a pivotal role in the Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), and it is an essential input to various smart mobility applications such as signal coordination and traffic flow prediction. The current practice to obtain the traffic state information is through specialized sensors such as loop detectors and speed cameras. In most metropolitan areas, traffic monitoring cameras have been installed to monitor the traffic conditions on arterial roads and expressways, and the collected videos or images are mainly used for visual inspection by traffic engineers. Unfortunately, the data collected from traffic monitoring cameras are affected by the 4L characteristics: Low frame rate, Low resolution, Lack of annotated data, and Located in complex road environments. Therefore, despite the great potentials of the traffic monitoring cameras, the 4L characteristics hinder them from providing useful traffic state information (e.g., speed, flow, density). This paper focuses on the traffic density estimation problem as it is widely applicable to various traffic surveillance systems. To the best of our knowledge, there is a lack of the holistic framework for addressing the 4L characteristics and extracting the traffic density information from traffic monitoring camera data. In view of this, this paper proposes a framework for estimating traffic density using uncalibrated traffic monitoring cameras with 4L characteristics. The proposed framework consists of two major components: camera calibration and vehicle detection. The camera calibration method estimates the actual length between pixels in the images and videos, and the vehicle counts are extracted from the deep-learning-based vehicle detection method. Combining the two components, high-granular traffic density can be estimated. To validate the proposed framework, two case studies were conducted in Hong Kong and Sacramento. The results show that the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) in camera calibration is less than 0.2 meters out of 6 meters, and the accuracy of vehicle detection under various conditions is approximately 90%. Overall, the MAE for the estimated density is 9.04 veh/km/lane in Hong Kong and 1.30 veh/km/lane in Sacramento. The research outcomes can be used to calibrate the speed-density fundamental diagrams, and the proposed framework can provide accurate and real-time traffic information without installing additional sensors.</p></details> |  |

We prove that under general conditions, there exists a phase transition between local and global traffic. More specifically, assume that the traffic rate between two nodes $u$ and $v$ is given by $R(u,v)=β^{-d(u,v)}$ where $d(u,v)$ is the distance between the nodes. Then there exists a constant $β_c$ that depends on the geometry of the network such that if $1<β<β_c$ the traffic is global and there is a small set of highly congested nodes called the core. However, if $β>β_c$ then the traffic is essentially local and the core is empty which implies very small congestion.</p></details> | 11 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Cross-city Few-Shot Traffic Forecasting via Traffic Pattern Bank](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.09727v1)** | 2023-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic forecasting is a critical service in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). Utilizing deep models to tackle this task relies heavily on data from traffic sensors or vehicle devices, while some cities might lack device support and thus have few available data. So, it is necessary to learn from data-rich cities and transfer the knowledge to data-scarce cities in order to improve the performance of traffic forecasting. To address this problem, we propose a cross-city few-shot traffic forecasting framework via Traffic Pattern Bank (TPB) due to that the traffic patterns are similar across cities. TPB utilizes a pre-trained traffic patch encoder to project raw traffic data from data-rich cities into high-dimensional space, from which a traffic pattern bank is generated through clustering. Then, the traffic data of the data-scarce city could query the traffic pattern bank and explicit relations between them are constructed. The metaknowledge is aggregated based on these relations and an adjacency matrix is constructed to guide a downstream spatial-temporal model in forecasting future traffic. The frequently used meta-training framework Reptile is adapted to find a better initial parameter for the learnable modules. Experiments on real-world traffic datasets show that TPB outperforms existing methods and demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach in cross-city few-shot traffic forecasting.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CIKM2023 (Long Paper)</p></details> |

| **[A method of combining traffic classification and traffic prediction based on machine learning in wireless networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.01590v1)** | 2023-04-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the increasing number of service types of wireless network and the increasingly obvious differentiation of quality of service (QoS) requirements, the traffic flow classification and traffic prediction technology are of great significance for wireless network to provide differentiated QoS guarantee. At present, the machine learning methods attract widespread attentions in the tuples based traffic flow classification as well as the time series based traffic flow prediction. However, most of the existing studies divide the traffic flow classification and traffic prediction into two independent processes, which leads to inaccurate classification and prediction results. Therefore, this paper proposes a method of joint wireless network traffic classification and traffic prediction based on machine learning. First, building different predictors based on traffic categories, so that different types of classified traffic can use more appropriate predictors for traffic prediction according to their categories. Secondly, the prediction results of different types of predictors, as a posteriori feature, are fed back to the classifiers as input features to improve the accuracy of the classifiers. The experimental results show that the proposed method has improves both the accuracy of traffic classification and traffic prediction in wireless networks.</p></details> |  |
| **[RegTraffic: A Regression Based Traffic Simulator for Spatiotemporal Traffic Modeling, Simulation and Visualization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.01245v1)** | 2023-01-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic simulation is a great tool to demonstrate complex traffic structures which can be extremely useful for the planning, development, and management of road traffic networks. Current traffic simulators offer limited features when it comes to interactive and adaptive traffic modeling. This paper presents RegTraffic, a novel interactive traffic simulator that integrates dynamic regression-based spatiotemporal traffic analysis to predict congestion of intercorrelated road segments. The simulator models traffic congestion of road segments depending on neighboring road links and temporal features of the dynamic traffic flow. The simulator provides a user-friendly web interface to select road segments of interest, receive user-defined traffic parameters, and visualize the traffic for the flow of correlated road links based on the user inputs and the underlying correlation of these road links. Performance evaluation shows that RegTraffic can effectively predict traffic congestion with a Mean Squared Error of 1.3 Km/h and a Root Mean Squared Error of 1.71 Km/h. RegTraffic can effectively simulate the results and provide visualization on interactive geographical maps.</p></details> |  |

Along with the rapidly growing automated vehicles and crowded cities, the automated and advanced traffic management systems (ATMS) using video surveillance infrastructures have been evolved by the implementation of Deep Neural Networks. In this research, we provide a practical platform for real-time traffic monitoring, including 3D vehicle/pedestrian detection, speed detection, trajectory estimation, congestion detection, as well as monitoring the interaction of vehicles and pedestrians, all using a single CCTV traffic camera. We adapt a custom YOLOv5 deep neural network model for vehicle/pedestrian detection and an enhanced SORT tracking algorithm. For the first time, a hybrid satellite-ground based inverse perspective mapping (SG-IPM) method for camera auto-calibration is also developed which leads to an accurate 3D object detection and visualisation. We also develop a hierarchical traffic modelling solution based on short- and long-term temporal video data stream to understand the traffic flow, bottlenecks, and risky spots for vulnerable road users. Several experiments on real-world scenarios and comparisons with state-of-the-art are conducted using various traffic monitoring datasets, including MIO-TCD, UA-DETRAC and GRAM-RTM collected from highways, intersections, and urban areas under different lighting and weather conditions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generalising Traffic Forecasting to Regions without Traffic Observations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.08947v1)** | 2025-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic forecasting is essential for intelligent transportation systems. Accurate forecasting relies on continuous observations collected by traffic sensors. However, due to high deployment and maintenance costs, not all regions are equipped with such sensors. This paper aims to forecast for regions without traffic sensors, where the lack of historical traffic observations challenges the generalisability of existing models. We propose a model named GenCast, the core idea of which is to exploit external knowledge to compensate for the missing observations and to enhance generalisation. We integrate physics-informed neural networks into GenCast, enabling physical principles to regularise the learning process. We introduce an external signal learning module to explore correlations between traffic states and external signals such as weather conditions, further improving model generalisability. Additionally, we design a spatial grouping module to filter localised features that hinder model generalisability. Extensive experiments show that GenCast consistently reduces forecasting errors on multiple real-world datasets.</p></details> |  |

Traditional approaches attempt to optimize traffic lights for a particular density and configuration of traffic. The disadvantage of this lies in the fact that traffic densities and configurations change constantly. Traffic seems to be an adaptation problem rather than an optimization problem. We propose a simple and feasible alternative, in which traffic lights self-organize to improve traffic flow. We use a multi-agent simulation to study three self-organizing methods, which are able to outperform traditional rigid and adaptive methods.

This is the first differentiable traffic simulator for macroscopic and hybrid models that can compute gradients for traffic states across time steps and inhomogeneous lanes. To compute the gradient flow between two types of traffic models in a hybrid framework, we present a novel intermediate conversion component that bridges the lanes in a differentiable manner as well. We also show that we can use analytical gradients to accelerate the overall process and enhance scalability. Thanks to these gradients, our simulator can provide more efficient and scalable solutions for complex learning and control problems posed in traffic engineering than other existing algorithms.

Although there are several public datasets, especially for metropolitan areas, these datasets may not be applicable to practical scenarios due to insufficiency in the scale of data (i.e. number of sensors and road links) and several external factors like different characteristics of the target area such as urban, highways and the data collection location. To address this, this paper introduces a novel IBB Traffic graph dataset as an alternative benchmark dataset to mitigate these limitations and enrich the literature with new geographical characteristics. IBB Traffic graph dataset covers the sensor data collected at 2451 distinct locations. Moreover, we propose a novel Road Traffic Prediction Model that strengthens temporal links through feature engineering, node embedding with GLEE to represent inter-related relationships within the traffic network, and traffic prediction with ExtraTrees. The results indicate that the proposed model consistently outperforms the baseline models, demonstrating an average accuracy improvement of 4%.</p></details> |  |

While numerous studies have addressed the issue of intelligent traffic systems in the context of various disturbances, traffic signal malfunction, a common real-world occurrence with significant repercussions, has received comparatively limited attention. The primary objective of this research is to mitigate the adverse effects of traffic signal malfunction, such as traffic congestion and collision, by optimizing the control of neighboring functioning signals. To achieve this goal, this paper presents a novel traffic signal control framework (MalLight), which leverages an Influence-aware State Aggregation Module (ISAM) and an Influence-aware Reward Aggregation Module (IRAM) to achieve coordinated control of surrounding traffic signals. To the best of our knowledge, this study pioneers the application of a Reinforcement Learning(RL)-based approach to address the challenges posed by traffic signal malfunction. Empirical investigations conducted on real-world datasets substantiate the superior performance of our proposed methodology over conventional and deep learning-based alternatives in the presence of signal malfunction, with reduction of throughput alleviated by as much as 48.6$\%$.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper accepted to CIKM24 Full Research track</p></details> |
| **[Multi-scale Traffic Pattern Bank for Cross-city Few-shot Traffic Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.00397v2)** | 2024-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic forecasting is crucial for intelligent transportation systems (ITS), aiding in efficient resource allocation and effective traffic control. However, its effectiveness often relies heavily on abundant traffic data, while many cities lack sufficient data due to limited device support, posing a significant challenge for traffic forecasting. Recognizing this challenge, we have made a noteworthy observation: traffic patterns exhibit similarities across diverse cities. Building on this key insight, we propose a solution for the cross-city few-shot traffic forecasting problem called Multi-scale Traffic Pattern Bank (MTPB). Primarily, MTPB initiates its learning process by leveraging data-rich source cities, effectively acquiring comprehensive traffic knowledge through a spatial-temporal-aware pre-training process. Subsequently, the framework employs advanced clustering techniques to systematically generate a multi-scale traffic pattern bank derived from the learned knowledge. Next, the traffic data of the data-scarce target city could query the traffic pattern bank, facilitating the aggregation of meta-knowledge. This meta-knowledge, in turn, assumes a pivotal role as a robust guide in subsequent processes involving graph reconstruction and forecasting. Empirical assessments conducted on real-world traffic datasets affirm the superior performance of MTPB, surpassing existing methods across various categories and exhibiting numerous attributes conducive to the advancement of cross-city few-shot forecasting methodologies. The code is available in https://github.com/zhyliu00/MTPB.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review. Text overlap with arXiv:2308.09727</p></details> |

Unfortunately, their generalization across different tasks and unseen data is very limited. Large language models (LLMs), known for their strong generalization capabilities, have shown promising performance in various domains. However, their application to the traffic analysis domain is limited due to significantly different characteristics of network traffic. To address the issue, in this paper, we propose TrafficLLM, which introduces a dual-stage fine-tuning framework to learn generic traffic representation from heterogeneous raw traffic data. The framework uses traffic-domain tokenization, dual-stage tuning pipeline, and extensible adaptation to help LLM release generalization ability on dynamic traffic analysis tasks, such that it enables traffic detection and traffic generation across a wide range of downstream tasks. We evaluate TrafficLLM across 10 distinct scenarios and 229 types of traffic. TrafficLLM achieves F1-scores of 0.9875 and 0.9483, with up to 80.12% and 33.92% better performance than existing detection and generation methods. It also shows strong generalization on unseen traffic with an 18.6% performance improvement. We further evaluate TrafficLLM in real-world scenarios. The results confirm that TrafficLLM is easy to scale and achieves accurate detection performance on enterprise traffic.</p></details> |  |

However, existing traffic simulators are limited by their lack of scalability and shortage in input data, which prevents them from generating interactive data from traffic simulation in the scenarios of real large-scale city road networks. In this paper, we present \textbf{C}ity \textbf{B}rain \textbf{Lab}, a toolkit for scalable traffic simulation. CBLab consists of three components: CBEngine, CBData, and CBScenario. CBEngine is a highly efficient simulator supporting large-scale traffic simulation. CBData includes a traffic dataset with road network data of 100 cities all around the world. We also develop a pipeline to conduct a one-click transformation from raw road networks to input data of our traffic simulation. Combining CBEngine and CBData allows researchers to run scalable traffic simulations in the road network of real large-scale cities. Based on that, CBScenario implements an interactive environment and a benchmark for two scenarios of traffic control policies respectively, with which traffic control policies adaptable for large-scale urban traffic can be trained and tuned. To the best of our knowledge, CBLab is the first infrastructure supporting traffic control policy optimization in large-scale urban scenarios.

| **[Realistic Traffic Generation for Web Robots](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.05813v1)** | 2018-02-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Critical to evaluating the capacity, scalability, and availability of web systems are realistic web traffic generators. Web traffic generation is a classic research problem, no generator accounts for the characteristics of web robots or crawlers that are now the dominant source of traffic to a web server. Administrators are thus unable to test, stress, and evaluate how their systems perform in the face of ever increasing levels of web robot traffic. To resolve this problem, this paper introduces a novel approach to generate synthetic web robot traffic with high fidelity. It generates traffic that accounts for both the temporal and behavioral qualities of robot traffic by statistical and Bayesian models that are fitted to the properties of robot traffic seen in web logs from North America and Europe. We evaluate our traffic generator by comparing the characteristics of generated traffic to those of the original data. We look at session arrival rates, inter-arrival times and session lengths, comparing and contrasting them between generated and real traffic. Finally, we show that our generated traffic affects cache performance similarly to actual traffic, using the common LRU and LFU eviction policies.</p></details> | 8 pages |

However, the lack of transparency in their predictions and decision-making has made network operators reluctant to deploy DL-based solutions in production networks. To tackle this challenge, we propose Traffic-Explainer, a model-agnostic and input-perturbation-based traffic explanation framework. By maximizing the mutual information between predictions on original traffic sequences and their masked counterparts, Traffic-Explainer automatically uncovers the most influential features driving model predictions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Traffic-Explainer improves upon existing explanation methods by approximately 42%. Practically, we further apply Traffic-Explainer to identify influential features and demonstrate its enhanced transparency across three critical tasks: application classification, traffic localization, and network cartography. For the first two tasks, Traffic-Explainer identifies the most decisive bytes that drive predicted traffic applications and locations, uncovering potential vulnerabilities and privacy concerns. In network cartography, Traffic-Explainer identifies submarine cables that drive the mapping of traceroute to physical path, enabling a traceroute-informed risk analysis.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we propose a simple deep learning based end-to-end detection framework, which effectively tackles challenges inherent to traffic sign and traffic light detection such as small size, large number of classes and complex road scenarios. We optimize the detection models using TensorRT and integrate with Robot Operating System to deploy on an Nvidia Jetson AGX Xavier as our embedded device. The overall system achieves a high inference speed of 63 frames per second, demonstrating the capability of our system to perform in real-time. Furthermore, we introduce CeyRo, which is the first ever large-scale traffic sign and traffic light detection dataset for the Sri Lankan context. Our dataset consists of 7984 total images with 10176 traffic sign and traffic light instances covering 70 traffic sign and 5 traffic light classes.

| **[Analyzing Traffic Delay at Unmanaged Intersections](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.02660v1)** | 2018-06-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>At an unmanaged intersection, it is important to understand how much traffic delay may be caused as a result of microscopic vehicle interactions. Conventional traffic simulations that explicitly track these interactions are time-consuming. Prior work introduced an analytical traffic model for unmanaged intersections. The traffic delay at the intersection is modeled as an event-driven stochastic process, whose dynamics encode microscopic vehicle interactions. This paper studies the traffic delay in a two-lane intersection using the model. We perform rigorous analyses concerning the distribution of traffic delay under different scenarios. We then discuss the relationships between traffic delay and multiple factors such as traffic flow density, unevenness of traffic flows, temporal gaps between two consecutive vehicles, and the passing order.</p></details> | <details><summary>under...</summary><p>under review in IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems</p></details> |
| **[Short-Term Traffic Forecasting Using High-Resolution Traffic Data](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.12292v1)** | 2021-01-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper develops a data-driven toolkit for traffic forecasting using high-resolution (a.k.a. event-based) traffic data. This is the raw data obtained from fixed sensors in urban roads. Time series of such raw data exhibit heavy fluctuations from one time step to the next (typically on the order of 0.1-1 second). Short-term forecasts (10-30 seconds into the future) of traffic conditions are critical for traffic operations applications (e.g., adaptive signal control). But traffic forecasting tools in the literature deal predominantly with 3-5 minute aggregated data, where the typical signal cycle is on the order of 2 minutes. This renders such forecasts useless at the operations level. To this end, we model the traffic forecasting problem as a matrix completion problem, where the forecasting inputs are mapped to a higher dimensional space using kernels. The formulation allows us to capture both nonlinear dependencies between forecasting inputs and outputs but also allows us to capture dependencies among the inputs. These dependencies correspond to correlations between different locations in the network. We further employ adaptive boosting to enhance the training accuracy and capture historical patterns in the data. The performance of the proposed methods is verified using high-resolution data obtained from a real-world traffic network in Abu Dhabi, UAE. Our experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art algorithms.</p></details> |  |

However, due to the rarity of traffic conflicts, collecting large-scale real-world traffic conflict data becomes extremely challenging. In this paper, we introduce and analyze ROCO - a real-world roundabout traffic conflict dataset. The data is collected at a two-lane roundabout at the intersection of State St. and W. Ellsworth Rd. in Ann Arbor, Michigan. We use raw video dataflow captured from four fisheye cameras installed at the roundabout as our input data source. We adopt a learning-based conflict identification algorithm from video to find potential traffic conflicts, and then manually label them for dataset collection and annotation. In total 557 traffic conflicts and 17 traffic crashes are collected from August 2021 to October 2021. We provide trajectory data of the traffic conflict scenes extracted using our roadside perception system. Taxonomy based on traffic conflict severity, reason for the traffic conflict, and its effect on the traffic flow is provided. With the traffic conflict data collected, we discover that failure to yield to circulating vehicles when entering the roundabout is the largest contributing reason for traffic conflicts. ROCO dataset will be made public in the short future.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by TRBAM 2023 presentation</p></details> |

Previous work on modeling the strategies of air traffic controllers and their mental image of traffic situations often centers on specific air traffic control tasks or pairwise interactions between aircraft, neglecting to capture the comprehensive dynamics of an air traffic situation. To address this issue, we propose a machine learning-based framework for explaining air traffic situations. Specifically, we employ a Transformer-based multi-agent trajectory model that encapsulates both the spatio-temporal movement of aircraft and social interaction between them. By deriving attention scores from the model, we can quantify the influence of individual aircraft on overall traffic dynamics. This provides explainable insights into how air traffic controllers perceive and understand the traffic situation. Trained on real-world air traffic surveillance data collected from the terminal airspace around Incheon International Airport in South Korea, our framework effectively explicates air traffic situations. This could potentially support and enhance the decision-making and situational awareness of air traffic controllers.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 3 figures, minor revisions to address reviewer feedback for final submission to the First US-Europe Air Transportation Research and Development (ATRD) Symposium</p></details> |
| **[Revisiting Flow Information for Traffic Prediction](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.00560v1)** | 2019-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic prediction is a fundamental task in many real applications, which aims to predict the future traffic volume in any region of a city. In essence, traffic volume in a region is the aggregation of traffic flows from/to the region. However, existing traffic prediction methods focus on modeling complex spatiotemporal traffic correlations and seldomly study the influence of the original traffic flows among regions. In this paper, we revisit the traffic flow information and exploit the direct flow correlations among regions towards more accurate traffic prediction. We introduce a novel flow-aware graph convolution to model dynamic flow correlations among regions. We further introduce an integrated Gated Recurrent Unit network to incorporate flow correlations with spatiotemporal modeling. The experimental results on real-world traffic datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, especially on the traffic conditions with a great change on flows.</p></details> |  |
| **[Traffic Forecasting on Traffic Moving Snippets](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.14383v1)** | 2021-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advances in traffic forecasting technology can greatly impact urban mobility. In the traffic4cast competition, the task of short-term traffic prediction is tackled in unprecedented detail, with traffic volume and speed information available at 5 minute intervals and high spatial resolution. To improve generalization to unknown cities, as required in the 2021 extended challenge, we propose to predict small quadratic city sections, rather than processing a full-city-raster at once. At test time, breaking down the test data into spatially-cropped overlapping snippets improves stability and robustness of the final predictions, since multiple patches covering one cell can be processed independently. With the performance on the traffic4cast test data and further experiments on a validation set it is shown that patch-wise prediction indeed improves accuracy. Further advantages can be gained with a Unet++ architecture and with an increasing number of patches per sample processed at test time. We conclude that our snippet-based method, combined with other successful network architectures proposed in the competition, can leverage performance, in particular on unseen cities.

Approximately 1,3 million people lose their lives daily due to traffic accidents [World Health Organization, 2022]. Addressing this issue requires accurate traffic law violation detection systems to ensure adherence to regulations. The integration of Artificial Intelligence algorithms, leveraging machine learning and computer vision, has facilitated the development of precise traffic rule enforcement. This paper illustrates how computer vision and machine learning enable the creation of robust algorithms for detecting various traffic violations. Our model, capable of identifying six common traffic infractions, detects red light violations, illegal use of breakdown lanes, violations of vehicle following distance, breaches of marked crosswalk laws, illegal parking, and parking on marked crosswalks. Utilizing online traffic footage and a self-mounted on-dash camera, we apply the YOLOv5 algorithm's detection module to identify traffic agents such as cars, pedestrians, and traffic signs, and the strongSORT algorithm for continuous interframe tracking. Six discrete algorithms analyze agents' behavior and trajectory to detect violations. Subsequently, an Identification Module extracts vehicle ID information, such as the license plate, to generate violation notices sent to relevant authorities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Classification of Traffic Using Neural Networks by Rejecting: a Novel Approach in Classifying VPN Traffic](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.03665v2)** | 2021-12-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we introduce a novel end-to-end traffic classification method to distinguish between traffic classes including VPN traffic in three layers of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model. Classification of VPN traffic is not trivial using traditional classification approaches due to its encrypted nature. We utilize two well-known neural networks, namely multi-layer perceptron and recurrent neural network to create our cascade neural network focused on two metrics: class scores and distance from the center of the classes. Such approach combines extraction, selection, and classification functionality into a single end-to-end system to systematically learn the non-linear relationship between input and predicted performance. Therefore, we could distinguish VPN traffics from non-VPN traffics by rejecting the unrelated features of the VPN class. Moreover, we obtain the application type of non-VPN traffics at the same time. The approach is evaluated using the general traffic dataset ISCX VPN-nonVPN, and an acquired dataset. The results demonstrate the efficacy of the framework approach for encrypting traffic classification while also achieving extreme accuracy, $95$ percent, which is higher than the accuracy of the state-of-the-art models, and strong generalization capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adversarial Network Traffic: Towards Evaluating the Robustness of Deep Learning-Based Network Traffic Classification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.01261v4)** | 2021-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Network traffic classification is used in various applications such as network traffic management, policy enforcement, and intrusion detection systems. Although most applications encrypt their network traffic and some of them dynamically change their port numbers, Machine Learning (ML) and especially Deep Learning (DL)-based classifiers have shown impressive performance in network traffic classification. In this paper, we evaluate the robustness of DL-based network traffic classifiers against Adversarial Network Traffic (ANT). ANT causes DL-based network traffic classifiers to predict incorrectly using Universal Adversarial Perturbation (UAP) generating methods. Since there is no need to buffer network traffic before sending ANT, it is generated live. We partition the input space of the DL-based network traffic classification into three categories: packet classification, flow content classification, and flow time series classification. To generate ANT, we propose three new attacks injecting UAP into network traffic. AdvPad attack injects a UAP into the content of packets to evaluate the robustness of packet classifiers. AdvPay attack injects a UAP into the payload of a dummy packet to evaluate the robustness of flow content classifiers. AdvBurst attack injects a specific number of dummy packets with crafted statistical features based on a UAP into a selected burst of a flow to evaluate the robustness of flow time series classifiers. The results indicate injecting a little UAP into network traffic, highly decreases the performance of DL-based network traffic classifiers in all categories.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 3 figures, and 7 tables.

However, existing works on traffic forecasting mainly relied on historical traffic patterns confining to short-term prediction, under 1 hour, for instance. To better manage future roadway capacity and accommodate social and human impacts, it is crucial to propose a flexible and comprehensive framework to predict physical-aware long-term traffic conditions for public users and transportation agencies. In this paper, the gap of robust long-term traffic forecasting was bridged by taking social media features into consideration. A correlation study and a linear regression model were first implemented to evaluate the significance of the correlation between two time-series data, traffic intensity and Twitter data intensity. Two time-series data were then fed into our proposed social-aware framework, Traffic-Twitter Transformer, which integrated Nature Language representations into time-series records for long-term traffic prediction. Experimental results in the Great Seattle Area showed that our proposed model outperformed baseline models in all evaluation matrices. This NLP-joined social-aware framework can become a valuable implement of network-wide traffic prediction and management for traffic agencies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Traffic dynamics on dynamical networks: The connection between network lifetime and traffic congestion](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.07099v1)** | 2016-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For many power-limited networks, such as wireless sensor networks and mobile ad hoc networks, maximizing the network lifetime is the first concern in the related designing and maintaining activities. We study the network lifetime from the perspective of network science. In our dynamic network, nodes are assigned a fixed amount of energy initially and consume the energy in the delivery of packets. We divided the network traffic flow into four states: no, slow, fast, and absolute congestion states. We derive the network lifetime by considering the state of the traffic flow. We find that the network lifetime is generally opposite to traffic congestion in that the more congested traffic, the less network lifetime. We also find the impacts of factors such as packet generation rate, communication radius, node moving speed, etc., on network lifetime and traffic congestion.</p></details> | 7 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Traffic Refinery: Cost-Aware Data Representation for Machine Learning on Network Traffic](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.14605v3)** | 2022-01-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Network management often relies on machine learning to make predictions about performance and security from network traffic. Often, the representation of the traffic is as important as the choice of the model. The features that the model relies on, and the representation of those features, ultimately determine model accuracy, as well as where and whether the model can be deployed in practice. Thus, the design and evaluation of these models ultimately requires understanding not only model accuracy but also the systems costs associated with deploying the model in an operational network. Towards this goal, this paper develops a new framework and system that enables a joint evaluation of both the conventional notions of machine learning performance (e.g., model accuracy) and the systems-level costs of different representations of network traffic. We highlight these two dimensions for two practical network management tasks, video streaming quality inference and malware detection, to demonstrate the importance of exploring different representations to find the appropriate operating point. We demonstrate the benefit of exploring a range of representations of network traffic and present Traffic Refinery, a proof-of-concept implementation that both monitors network traffic at 10 Gbps and transforms traffic in real time to produce a variety of feature representations for machine learning. Traffic Refinery both highlights this design space and makes it possible to explore different representations for learning, balancing systems costs related to feature extraction and model training against model accuracy.</p></details> |  |

With growing urbanization, traffic congestion has intensified, highlighting the need for reliable and responsive forecasting models. In recent years, deep learning, particularly Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), has emerged as the mainstream paradigm in traffic forecasting. GNNs can effectively capture complex spatial dependencies in road network topology and dynamic temporal evolution patterns in traffic flow data. Foundational models such as STGCN and GraphWaveNet, along with more recent developments including STWave and D2STGNN, have achieved impressive performance on standard traffic datasets. These approaches incorporate sophisticated graph convolutional structures and temporal modeling mechanisms, demonstrating particular effectiveness in capturing and forecasting traffic patterns characterized by periodic regularities. To address this challenge, researchers have explored various ways to incorporate event information. Early attempts primarily relied on manually engineered event features. For instance, some approaches introduced manually defined incident effect scores or constructed specific subgraphs for different event-induced traffic conditions. While these methods somewhat enhance responsiveness to specific events, their core drawback lies in a heavy reliance on domain experts' prior knowledge, making generalization to diverse and complex unknown events difficult, and low-dimensional manual features often lead to the loss of rich semantic details.</p></details> |  |

While most existing systems produce good results on large traffic lights, detecting small and tiny ones is often overlooked. A key problem here is the inherent downsampling in CNNs, leading to low-resolution features for detection. To mitigate this problem, we propose a new traffic light detection system, comprising a novel traffic light proposal generator that utilizes findings from general object proposal generation, fine-grained multi-scale features, and attention for efficient processing. Moreover, we design a new detection head for classifying and refining our proposals. We evaluate our system on three challenging, publicly available datasets and compare it against six methods. The results show substantial improvements of at least $12.6\%$ on small and tiny traffic lights, as well as strong results across all sizes of traffic lights.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICVS 2023</p></details> |

It is of a great importance to understand the complex interplay of road networks and traffic conditions. The authors propose a novel framework to estimate traffic conditions at the metropolitan scale using GPS traces. Their approach begins with an initial estimation of network travel times by solving a convex optimization program based on traffic flow theory. Then, they iteratively refine the estimated network travel times and vehicle traversed paths. Last, the authors perform a bilevel optimization process to estimate traffic conditions on road segments that are not covered by GPS data. The evaluation and comparison of the authors' approach over two state-of-the-art methods show up to 96.57% relative improvements. The authors have further conducted field tests by coupling road networks of San Francisco and Beijing with real-world GIS data, which involve 128,701 nodes, 148,899 road segments, and over 26 million GPS traces.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in Transportation Research Board 97th Annual Meeting, 2018</p></details> |

Our team also discover the impact of weather conditions and nearby traffic volume on the traffic flow at a target point. The analysis results will help solve the problem of traffic flow prediction and develop an optimal transport network with efficient traffic movement and minimal traffic congestion. Hourly historical weather and traffic flow data are selected to solve this problem. This paper uses model VAR(36) with time trend and constant to train the dataset and forecast. With an RMSE of 565.0768111 on average, the model is considered appropriate although some statistical tests implies that the residuals are unstable and non-normal. Also, this paper points out some variables that are not useful in forecasting, which helps simplify the data-collecting process when building the forecasting system.</p></details> | <details><summary>Inter...</summary><p>International Conference on Computing and Communication Technologies (RIVF2022)</p></details> |

As in many other cyber-physical systems, smart traffic management systems typically lack security measures. This allows numerous opportunities for adversarial entities to craft attacks on the sensor networks, wireless data sharing and/or the distributed traffic controllers. We show that such vulnerabilities can be exploited to disrupt mobility in a large urban area and cause unsafe conditions for drivers and the pedestrians on the roads. Specifically, in this paper, we look into vulnerabilities in model-based traffic controllers and show that, even with state-of-the-art attack detectors in place, false-data injection can be used to hamper mobility. We demonstrate a replay attack by modeling an isolated intersection in VISSIM, a popular traffic simulator and also discuss countermeasures to thwart such attacks.</p></details> |  |

We then introduce an emotion-based traffic simulation, which utilizes the Weber-Fechner law to integrate economic factors into drivers' behaviors. Simulation results show that the CATS framework can significantly reduce traffic accidents and improve urban traffic conditions.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Braess Paradox in Dynamic Traffic](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.03726v2)** | 2023-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Braess's Paradox (BP) is the observation that adding one or more roads to the existing road network will counter-intuitively increase traffic congestion and slow down the overall traffic flow. Previously, the existence of the BP is modeled using the static traffic assignment model, which solves for the user equilibrium subject to network flow conservation to find the equilibrium state and distributes all vehicles instantaneously. Such approach neglects the dynamic nature of real-world traffic, including vehicle behaviors and the interaction between vehicles and the infrastructure. As such, this article proposes a dynamic traffic network model and empirically validates the existence of the BP under dynamic traffic. In particular, we use microsimulation environment to study the impacts of an added path on a grid network. We explore how the network flow, vehicle travel time, and network capacity respond, as well as when the BP will occur.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by 2022 IEEE Intelligent Transportation Systems Conference (ITSC): https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9921998</p></details> |

Additionally, interpreting and adhering to traffic regulations within rapidly evolving traffic scenarios pose significant hurdles. This paper proposed a rule-based autonomous vehicle decision-making and planning framework which extracts right-of-way from traffic rules to generate behavioural parameters, integrating them to effectively adhere to and navigate through traffic regulations. The framework considers the strong interaction between traffic participants mathematically by formulating the decision-making and planning problem into a differential game. By finding the Nash equilibrium of the problem, the autonomous vehicle is able to find optimal decisions. The proposed framework was tested under simulation as well as full-size vehicle platform, the results show that the ego vehicle is able to safely interact with surrounding traffic participants while adhering to traffic rules.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is already accepted on IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems</p></details> |

This area has continually captured the extensive focus of both the academic and industrial sectors. Identifying and comprehending complex traffic events is highly challenging, primarily due to the intricate nature of traffic environments, diverse observational perspectives, and the multifaceted causes of accidents. These factors have persistently impeded the development of effective solutions. The advent of large vision-language models (VLMs) such as GPT-4V, has introduced innovative approaches to addressing this issue. In this paper, we explore the ability of GPT-4V with a set of representative traffic incident videos and delve into the model's capacity of understanding these complex traffic situations. We observe that GPT-4V demonstrates remarkable cognitive, reasoning, and decision-making ability in certain classic traffic events. Concurrently, we also identify certain limitations of GPT-4V, which constrain its understanding in more intricate scenarios. These limitations merit further exploration and resolution.</p></details> |  |

To develop novel applications for this area a high number of tests, considering all traffic situations, are demanded. However, it is unfeasible to reproduce these tests in real life, by the fact that any failure on the applications would cause severe impacts on transport system safety and could risk human lives. Thus, this paper presents the concept, model, and validation for InTAS, a realistic traffic scenario for Ingolstadt. InTAS road topology accurately represents Ingolstadt real road map. Elements such as buildings, bus stops, and traffic lights were added to the map. Twenty traffic lights systems were simulated according to the real program deployed on the traffic lights. Traffic demand was modeled based on the activitygen method, considering demographic data and real-traffic information. The city public transport system was also simulated accordingly to bus time-tables and their routes. The simulation step was implemented considering the best value for device.rerouting.probability, which was defined by evaluating InTAS output and real traffic data. The scenario was validated by comparing real-traffic data from 24 measurement points with InTAS simulation results.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper presented on SUMO User Conference 2020 The scenario is freely available at https://github.com/silaslobo/InTAS</p></details> |

Compared with traditional reinforcement learning and recent LLM-based methods, Traffic-R1 offers three main advantages: zero-shot generalization, transferring unchanged to new road networks and out-of-distribution incidents by leveraging internal traffic-control policies and reasoning; a compact 3B-parameter design that supports real-time inference on mobile-class chips for edge deployment; and an explainable TSC process that enables multi-intersection coordination through communication and an asynchronous communication network. Extensive benchmarks show Traffic-R1 outperforms strong baselines and training-intensive RL controllers. In production, the model now manages signals affecting over 55,000 drivers daily, reduces average queue lengths by more than 5%, and halves operator workload.

| **[Coping with Large Traffic Volumes in Schedule-Driven Traffic Signal Control](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.04278v1)** | 2019-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent work in decentralized, schedule-driven traffic control has demonstrated the ability to significantly improve traffic flow efficiency in complex urban road networks. However, in situations where vehicle volumes increase to the point that the physical capacity of a road network reaches or exceeds saturation, it has been observed that the effectiveness of a schedule-driven approach begins to degrade, leading to progressively higher network congestion. In essence, the traffic control problem becomes less of a scheduling problem and more of a queue management problem in this circumstance. In this paper we propose a composite approach to real-time traffic control that uses sensed information on queue lengths to influence scheduling decisions and gracefully shift the signal control strategy to queue management in high volume/high congestion settings. Specifically, queue-length information is used to establish weights for the sensed vehicle clusters that must be scheduled through a given intersection at any point, and hence bias the wait time minimization calculation. To compute these weights, we develop a model in which successive movement phases are viewed as different states of an Ising model, and parameters quantify strength of interactions. To ensure scalability, queue information is only exchanged between direct neighbors and the asynchronous nature of local intersection scheduling is preserved. We demonstrate the potential of the approach through microscopic traffic simulation of a real-world road network, showing a 60% reduction in average wait times over the baseline schedule-driven approach in heavy traffic scenarios. We also report initial field test results, which show the ability to reduce queues during heavy traffic periods.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICAPS...</summary><p>ICAPS 2017.

For example, New York City (NYC) provides open access to taxi data from year 2012 to 2015 with about half million taxi trips generated per day. In the meantime, we have a rich set of urban data in NYC including points-of-interest (POIs), geo-tagged tweets, weather, vehicle collisions, etc. Is it possible that these ubiquitous datasets can be used to explain the city traffic? Understanding the hidden correlation between external data and traffic data would allow us to answer many important questions in urban computing such as: If we observe a high traffic volume at Madison Square Garden (MSG) in NYC, is it because of the regular peak hour or a big event being held at MSG? If a disaster weather such as a hurricane or a snow storm hits the city, how would the traffic be affected? While existing studies may utilize external datasets for prediction task, they do not explicitly seek for direct explanations from the external datasets. In this paper, we present our results in attempts to understand taxi traffic dynamics in NYC from multiple external data sources. We use four real-world ubiquitous urban datasets, including POI, weather, geo-tagged tweet, and collision records. To address the heterogeneity of ubiquitous urban data, we present carefully-designed feature representations for various datasets. Extensive experiments on real data demonstrate the explanatory power on taxi traffic by using external datasets. More specifically, our analysis suggests that POIs can well describe the regular traffic patterns. At the same time, geo-tagged tweets can explain irregular traffic caused by big events and weather can explain the abnormal traffic drop.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript is an extended version of the paper "Interpreting Traffic Dynamics using Ubiquitous Urban Data", Fei Wu, Hongjian Wang, Zhenhui Li, in Proceedings of the 24th ACM International Conference on Advances in Geographical Information Systems (SIGSPATIAL'16)</p></details> |

Most existing methods are tailored for individual forecasting or imputation tasks but are not designed for both. Additionally, they are less effective for zero-shot and few-shot learning. While pre-trained language model (PLM) have exhibited strong pattern recognition and reasoning abilities across various tasks, including few-shot and zero-shot learning, their applications in spatial-temporal data understanding has been constrained by insufficient modeling of complex correlations such as the temporal correlations, spatial connectivity, non-pairwise and high-order spatial-temporal correlations within data. In this paper, we propose STD-PLM for understanding both spatial and temporal properties of \underline{S}patial-\underline{T}emporal \underline{D}ata with \underline{PLM}, which is capable of implementing both spatial-temporal forecasting and imputation tasks. STD-PLM understands spatial-temporal correlations via explicitly designed spatial and temporal tokenizers. Topology-aware node embeddings are designed for PLM to comprehend and exploit the topology structure of data in inductive manner. Furthermore, to mitigate the efficiency issues introduced by the PLM, we design a sandglass attention module (SGA) combined with a specific constrained loss function, which significantly improves the model's efficiency while ensuring performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that STD-PLM exhibits competitive performance and generalization capabilities across the forecasting and imputation tasks on various datasets. Moreover, STD-PLM achieves promising results on both few-shot and zero-shot tasks.

| **[Spatial-temporal Transformers for EEG Emotion Recognition](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.06553v2)** | 2022-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electroencephalography (EEG) is a popular and effective tool for emotion recognition. However, the propagation mechanisms of EEG in the human brain and its intrinsic correlation with emotions are still obscure to researchers. This work proposes four variant transformer frameworks~(spatial attention, temporal attention, sequential spatial-temporal attention and simultaneous spatial-temporal attention) for EEG emotion recognition to explore the relationship between emotion and spatial-temporal EEG features. Specifically, spatial attention and temporal attention are to learn the topological structure information and time-varying EEG characteristics for emotion recognition respectively. Sequential spatial-temporal attention does the spatial attention within a one-second segment and temporal attention within one sample sequentially to explore the influence degree of emotional stimulation on EEG signals of diverse EEG electrodes in the same temporal segment. The simultaneous spatial-temporal attention, whose spatial and temporal attention are performed simultaneously, is used to model the relationship between different spatial features in different time segments. The experimental results demonstrate that simultaneous spatial-temporal attention leads to the best emotion recognition accuracy among the design choices, indicating modeling the correlation of spatial and temporal features of EEG signals is significant to emotion recognition.</p></details> |  |
| **[Blockwise Temporal-Spatial Pathway Network](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.03040v1)** | 2022-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Algorithms for video action recognition should consider not only spatial information but also temporal relations, which remains challenging. We propose a 3D-CNN-based action recognition model, called the blockwise temporal-spatial path-way network (BTSNet), which can adjust the temporal and spatial receptive fields by multiple pathways. We designed a novel model inspired by an adaptive kernel selection-based model, which is an architecture for effective feature encoding that adaptively chooses spatial receptive fields for image recognition. Expanding this approach to the temporal domain, our model extracts temporal and channel-wise attention and fuses information on various candidate operations. For evaluation, we tested our proposed model on UCF-101, HMDB-51, SVW, and Epic-Kitchen datasets and showed that it generalized well without pretraining. BTSNet also provides interpretable visualization based on spatiotemporal channel-wise attention. We confirm that the blockwise temporal-spatial pathway supports a better representation for 3D convolutional blocks based on this visualization.</p></details> | ICIP 2021 |
| **[Spatial-Temporal Person Re-identification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.03282v1)** | 2018-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most of current person re-identification (ReID) methods neglect a spatial-temporal constraint. Given a query image, conventional methods compute the feature distances between the query image and all the gallery images and return a similarity ranked table. When the gallery database is very large in practice, these approaches fail to obtain a good performance due to appearance ambiguity across different camera views. In this paper, we propose a novel two-stream spatial-temporal person ReID (st-ReID) framework that mines both visual semantic information and spatial-temporal information. To this end, a joint similarity metric with Logistic Smoothing (LS) is introduced to integrate two kinds of heterogeneous information into a unified framework. To approximate a complex spatial-temporal probability distribution, we develop a fast Histogram-Parzen (HP) method. With the help of the spatial-temporal constraint, the st-ReID model eliminates lots of irrelevant images and thus narrows the gallery database. Without bells and whistles, our st-ReID method achieves rank-1 accuracy of 98.1\% on Market-1501 and 94.4\% on DukeMTMC-reID, improving from the baselines 91.2\% and 83.8\%, respectively, outperforming all previous state-of-the-art methods by a large margin.</p></details> | AAAI 2019 |
| **[When Spatial meets Temporal in Action Recognition](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.15284v1)** | 2024-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video action recognition has made significant strides, but challenges remain in effectively using both spatial and temporal information. While existing methods often focus on either spatial features (e.g., object appearance) or temporal dynamics (e.g., motion), they rarely address the need for a comprehensive integration of both. Capturing the rich temporal evolution of video frames, while preserving their spatial details, is crucial for improving accuracy. In this paper, we introduce the Temporal Integration and Motion Enhancement (TIME) layer, a novel preprocessing technique designed to incorporate temporal information. The TIME layer generates new video frames by rearranging the original sequence, preserving temporal order while embedding $N^2$ temporally evolving frames into a single spatial grid of size $N \times N$. This transformation creates new frames that balance both spatial and temporal information, making them compatible with existing video models. When $N=1$, the layer captures rich spatial details, similar to existing methods. As $N$ increases ($N\geq2$), temporal information becomes more prominent, while the spatial information decreases to ensure compatibility with model inputs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the TIME layer by integrating it into popular action recognition models, such as ResNet-50, Vision Transformer, and Video Masked Autoencoders, for both RGB and depth video data. Our experiments show that the TIME layer enhances recognition accuracy, offering valuable insights for video processing tasks.</p></details> | Research report |
| **[Temporal-Spatial Mapping for Action Recognition](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.03669v1)** | 2018-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning models have enjoyed great success for image related computer vision tasks like image classification and object detection. For video related tasks like human action recognition, however, the advancements are not as significant yet. The main challenge is the lack of effective and efficient models in modeling the rich temporal spatial information in a video. We introduce a simple yet effective operation, termed Temporal-Spatial Mapping (TSM), for capturing the temporal evolution of the frames by jointly analyzing all the frames of a video. We propose a video level 2D feature representation by transforming the convolutional features of all frames to a 2D feature map, referred to as VideoMap. With each row being the vectorized feature representation of a frame, the temporal-spatial features are compactly represented, while the temporal dynamic evolution is also well embedded. Based on the VideoMap representation, we further propose a temporal attention model within a shallow convolutional neural network to efficiently exploit the temporal-spatial dynamics. The experiment results show that the proposed scheme achieves the state-of-the-art performance, with 4.2% accuracy gain over Temporal Segment Network (TSN), a competing baseline method, on the challenging human action benchmark dataset HMDB51.</p></details> |  |

With the advancements in RNNs, CNNs, and other non-generative techniques, researchers have explored their application in capturing temporal and spatial dependencies within spatial-temporal data. However, the emergence of generative techniques such as LLMs, SSL, Seq2Seq and diffusion models has opened up new possibilities for enhancing spatial-temporal data mining further. The paper provides a comprehensive analysis of generative technique-based spatial-temporal methods and introduces a standardized framework specifically designed for the spatial-temporal data mining pipeline. By offering a detailed review and a novel taxonomy of spatial-temporal methodology utilizing generative techniques, the paper enables a deeper understanding of the various techniques employed in this field. Furthermore, the paper highlights promising future research directions, urging researchers to delve deeper into spatial-temporal data mining. It emphasizes the need to explore untapped opportunities and push the boundaries of knowledge to unlock new insights and improve the effectiveness and efficiency of spatial-temporal data mining. By integrating generative techniques and providing a standardized framework, the paper contributes to advancing the field and encourages researchers to explore the vast potential of generative techniques in spatial-temporal data mining.</p></details> | 19 pages |
| **[Grouped Spatial-Temporal Aggregation for Efficient Action Recognition](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.13130v1)** | 2019-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal reasoning is an important aspect of video analysis. 3D CNN shows good performance by exploring spatial-temporal features jointly in an unconstrained way, but it also increases the computational cost a lot. Previous works try to reduce the complexity by decoupling the spatial and temporal filters. In this paper, we propose a novel decomposition method that decomposes the feature channels into spatial and temporal groups in parallel. This decomposition can make two groups focus on static and dynamic cues separately. We call this grouped spatial-temporal aggregation (GST). This decomposition is more parameter-efficient and enables us to quantitatively analyze the contributions of spatial and temporal features in different layers. We verify our model on several action recognition tasks that require temporal reasoning and show its effectiveness.</p></details> | ICCV 2019 |
| **[Spatial-Temporal Knowledge Distillation for Takeaway Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.16502v2)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The takeaway recommendation system aims to recommend users' future takeaway purchases based on their historical purchase behaviors, thereby improving user satisfaction and boosting merchant sales. Existing methods focus on incorporating auxiliary information or leveraging knowledge graphs to alleviate the sparsity issue of user purchase sequences. However, two main challenges limit the performance of these approaches: (1) capturing dynamic user preferences on complex geospatial information and (2) efficiently integrating spatial-temporal knowledge from both graphs and sequence data with low computational costs. In this paper, we propose a novel spatial-temporal knowledge distillation model for takeaway recommendation (STKDRec) based on the two-stage training process. Specifically, during the first pre-training stage, a spatial-temporal knowledge graph (STKG) encoder is trained to extract high-order spatial-temporal dependencies and collaborative associations from the STKG. During the second spatial-temporal knowledge distillation (STKD) stage, a spatial-temporal Transformer (ST-Transformer) is employed to comprehensively model dynamic user preferences on various types of fine-grained geospatial information from a sequential perspective. Furthermore, the STKD strategy is introduced to transfer graph-based spatial-temporal knowledge to the ST-Transformer, facilitating the adaptive fusion of rich knowledge derived from both the STKG and sequence data while reducing computational overhead. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets show that STKDRec significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> | Accepted by AAAI2025 |

Although recent methods have achieved promising performance, most of them just consider spatial influence of the interactions and ignore the fact that temporal influence always accompanies spatial influence. Moreover, those methods based on scene information always require extra segmented scene images to generate multiple socially acceptable trajectories. To solve these limitations, we propose a novel model named spatial-temporal attentive network with spatial continuity (STAN-SC). First, spatial-temporal attention mechanism is presented to explore the most useful and important information. Second, we conduct a joint feature sequence based on the sequence and instant state information to make the generative trajectories keep spatial continuity. Experiments are performed on the two widely used ETH-UCY datasets and demonstrate that the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art prediction accuracy and handles more complex scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>bad m...</summary><p>bad model settings and unclear results</p></details> |

Existing methods often treat road networks over time as spatial-temporal graphs, addressing spatial and temporal representations independently. However, these approaches struggle to capture the dynamic topology of road networks, encounter issues with message passing mechanisms and over-smoothing, and face challenges in learning spatial and temporal relationships separately. To address these limitations, we propose treating nodes in road networks at different time steps as independent spatial-temporal tokens and feeding them into a vanilla Transformer to learn complex spatial-temporal patterns, design \textbf{STformer} achieving SOTA. Given its quadratic complexity, we introduce a variant \textbf{NSTformer} based on Nystr$\ddot{o}$m method to approximate self-attention with linear complexity but even slightly better than former in a few cases astonishingly. Extensive experimental results on traffic datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance at an affordable computational cost.

| **[STF: Spatial Temporal Fusion for Trajectory Prediction](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.18149v2)** | 2025-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction is a challenging task that aims to predict the future trajectory of vehicles or pedestrians over a short time horizon based on their historical positions. The main reason is that the trajectory is a kind of complex data, including spatial and temporal information, which is crucial for accurate prediction. Intuitively, the more information the model can capture, the more precise the future trajectory can be predicted. However, previous works based on deep learning methods processed spatial and temporal information separately, leading to inadequate spatial information capture, which means they failed to capture the complete spatial information. Therefore, it is of significance to capture information more fully and effectively on vehicle interactions. In this study, we introduced an integrated 3D graph that incorporates both spatial and temporal edges. Based on this, we proposed the integrated 3D graph, which considers the cross-time interaction information. In specific, we design a Spatial-Temporal Fusion (STF) model including Multi-layer perceptions (MLP) and Graph Attention (GAT) to capture the spatial and temporal information historical trajectories simultaneously on the 3D graph. Our experiment on the ApolloScape Trajectory Datasets shows that the proposed STF outperforms several baseline methods, especially on the long-time-horizon trajectory prediction.</p></details> | 6 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Jointly spatial-temporal representation learning for individual trajectories](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.04055v3)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Individual trajectories, rich in human-environment interaction information across space and time, serve as vital inputs for geospatial foundation models (GeoFMs). However, existing attempts at learning trajectory representations have overlooked the implicit spatial-temporal dependency within trajectories, failing to encode such dependency in a deep learning-friendly format. That poses a challenge in obtaining general-purpose trajectory representations. Therefore, this paper proposes a spatial-temporal joint representation learning method (ST-GraphRL) to formalize learnable spatial-temporal dependencies into trajectory representations. The proposed ST-GraphRL consists of three compositions: (i) a weighted directed spatial-temporal graph to explicitly construct mobility interactions in both space and time dimensions; (ii) a two-stage jointly encoder (i.e., decoupling and fusion), to learn entangled spatial-temporal dependencies by independently decomposing and jointly aggregating space and time information; (iii) a decoder guides ST-GraphRL to learn explicit mobility regularities by simulating the spatial-temporal distributions of trajectories. Tested on three real-world human mobility datasets, the proposed ST-GraphRL outperformed all the baseline models in predicting movement spatial-temporal distributions and preserving trajectory similarity with high spatial-temporal correlations. Analyzing spatial-temporal features presented in latent space validates that ST-GraphRL understands spatial-temporal patterns. This study may also benefit representation learnings of other geospatial data to achieve general-purpose data representations and advance GeoFMs development.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 3 tables, 7 figures</p></details> |

However, due to the appearance ambiguities of vehicle, the previous appearance-based ReID methods often fail to track vehicle across multiple cameras. To overcome the challenge, we propose a spatial-temporal vehicle ReID framework that estimates reliable camera network topology based on the adaptive Parzen window method and optimally combines the appearance and spatial-temporal similarities through the fusion network. Based on the proposed methods, we performed superior performance on the public dataset (VeRi776) by 99.64% of rank-1 accuracy. The experimental results support that utilizing spatial and temporal information for ReID can leverage the accuracy of appearance-based methods and effectively deal with appearance ambiguities.</p></details> | 10 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Synthesizing Dynamic Patterns by Spatial-Temporal Generative ConvNet](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.00972v2)** | 2017-05-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video sequences contain rich dynamic patterns, such as dynamic texture patterns that exhibit stationarity in the temporal domain, and action patterns that are non-stationary in either spatial or temporal domain. We show that a spatial-temporal generative ConvNet can be used to model and synthesize dynamic patterns. The model defines a probability distribution on the video sequence, and the log probability is defined by a spatial-temporal ConvNet that consists of multiple layers of spatial-temporal filters to capture spatial-temporal patterns of different scales. The model can be learned from the training video sequences by an "analysis by synthesis" learning algorithm that iterates the following two steps. Step 1 synthesizes video sequences from the currently learned model. Step 2 then updates the model parameters based on the difference between the synthesized video sequences and the observed training sequences. We show that the learning algorithm can synthesize realistic dynamic patterns.</p></details> |  |
| **[Localised Adaptive Spatial-Temporal Graph Neural Network](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.06930v2)** | 2023-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial-temporal graph models are prevailing for abstracting and modelling spatial and temporal dependencies. In this work, we ask the following question: whether and to what extent can we localise spatial-temporal graph models? We limit our scope to adaptive spatial-temporal graph neural networks (ASTGNNs), the state-of-the-art model architecture. Our approach to localisation involves sparsifying the spatial graph adjacency matrices. To this end, we propose Adaptive Graph Sparsification (AGS), a graph sparsification algorithm which successfully enables the localisation of ASTGNNs to an extreme extent (fully localisation). We apply AGS to two distinct ASTGNN architectures and nine spatial-temporal datasets. Intriguingly, we observe that spatial graphs in ASTGNNs can be sparsified by over 99.5\% without any decline in test accuracy. Furthermore, even when ASTGNNs are fully localised, becoming graph-less and purely temporal, we record no drop in accuracy for the majority of tested datasets, with only minor accuracy deterioration observed in the remaining datasets. However, when the partially or fully localised ASTGNNs are reinitialised and retrained on the same data, there is a considerable and consistent drop in accuracy. Based on these observations, we reckon that \textit{(i)} in the tested data, the information provided by the spatial dependencies is primarily included in the information provided by the temporal dependencies and, thus, can be essentially ignored for inference; and \textit{(ii)} although the spatial dependencies provide redundant information, it is vital for the effective training of ASTGNNs and thus cannot be ignored during training. Furthermore, the localisation of ASTGNNs holds the potential to reduce the heavy computation overhead required on large-scale spatial-temporal data and further enable the distributed deployment of ASTGNNs.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper was accepted by KDD 2023</p></details> |
| **[Spiking Transformer with Spatial-Temporal Attention](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.19764v3)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spike-based Transformer presents a compelling and energy-efficient alternative to traditional Artificial Neural Network (ANN)-based Transformers, achieving impressive results through sparse binary computations. However, existing spike-based transformers predominantly focus on spatial attention while neglecting crucial temporal dependencies inherent in spike-based processing, leading to suboptimal feature representation and limited performance. To address this limitation, we propose Spiking Transformer with Spatial-Temporal Attention (STAtten), a simple and straightforward architecture that efficiently integrates both spatial and temporal information in the self-attention mechanism. STAtten introduces a block-wise computation strategy that processes information in spatial-temporal chunks, enabling comprehensive feature capture while maintaining the same computational complexity as previous spatial-only approaches. Our method can be seamlessly integrated into existing spike-based transformers without architectural overhaul. Extensive experiments demonstrate that STAtten significantly improves the performance of existing spike-based transformers across both static and neuromorphic datasets, including CIFAR10/100, ImageNet, CIFAR10-DVS, and N-Caltech101.

| **[HGAurban: Heterogeneous Graph Autoencoding for Urban Spatial-Temporal Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.10915v2)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial-temporal graph representations play a crucial role in urban sensing applications, including traffic analysis, human mobility behavior modeling, and citywide crime prediction. However, a key challenge lies in the noisy and sparse nature of spatial-temporal data, which limits existing neural networks' ability to learn meaningful region representations in the spatial-temporal graph. To overcome these limitations, we propose HGAurban, a novel heterogeneous spatial-temporal graph masked autoencoder that leverages generative self-supervised learning for robust urban data representation. Our framework introduces a spatial-temporal heterogeneous graph encoder that extracts region-wise dependencies from multi-source data, enabling comprehensive modeling of diverse spatial relationships. Within our self-supervised learning paradigm, we implement a masked autoencoder that jointly processes node features and graph structure. This approach automatically learns heterogeneous spatial-temporal patterns across regions, significantly improving the representation of dynamic temporal correlations. Comprehensive experiments across multiple spatiotemporal mining tasks demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods and robustly handles real-world urban data challenges, including noise and sparsity in both spatial and temporal dimensions.</p></details> | 10 pages |
| **[Decoupled Spatial-Temporal Transformer for Video Inpainting](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.06637v1)** | 2021-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video inpainting aims to fill the given spatiotemporal holes with realistic appearance but is still a challenging task even with prosperous deep learning approaches. Recent works introduce the promising Transformer architecture into deep video inpainting and achieve better performance. However, it still suffers from synthesizing blurry texture as well as huge computational cost. Towards this end, we propose a novel Decoupled Spatial-Temporal Transformer (DSTT) for improving video inpainting with exceptional efficiency. Our proposed DSTT disentangles the task of learning spatial-temporal attention into 2 sub-tasks: one is for attending temporal object movements on different frames at same spatial locations, which is achieved by temporally-decoupled Transformer block, and the other is for attending similar background textures on same frame of all spatial positions, which is achieved by spatially-decoupled Transformer block. The interweaving stack of such two blocks makes our proposed model attend background textures and moving objects more precisely, and thus the attended plausible and temporally-coherent appearance can be propagated to fill the holes. In addition, a hierarchical encoder is adopted before the stack of Transformer blocks, for learning robust and hierarchical features that maintain multi-level local spatial structure, resulting in the more representative token vectors. Seamless combination of these two novel designs forms a better spatial-temporal attention scheme and our proposed model achieves better performance than state-of-the-art video inpainting approaches with significant boosted efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatial-Temporal Transformer Networks for Traffic Flow Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.02908v2)** | 2021-03-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic forecasting has emerged as a core component of intelligent transportation systems. However, timely accurate traffic forecasting, especially long-term forecasting, still remains an open challenge due to the highly nonlinear and dynamic spatial-temporal dependencies of traffic flows. In this paper, we propose a novel paradigm of Spatial-Temporal Transformer Networks (STTNs) that leverages dynamical directed spatial dependencies and long-range temporal dependencies to improve the accuracy of long-term traffic forecasting. Specifically, we present a new variant of graph neural networks, named spatial transformer, by dynamically modeling directed spatial dependencies with self-attention mechanism to capture realtime traffic conditions as well as the directionality of traffic flows. Furthermore, different spatial dependency patterns can be jointly modeled with multi-heads attention mechanism to consider diverse relationships related to different factors (e.g. similarity, connectivity and covariance). On the other hand, the temporal transformer is utilized to model long-range bidirectional temporal dependencies across multiple time steps. Finally, they are composed as a block to jointly model the spatial-temporal dependencies for accurate traffic prediction. Compared to existing works, the proposed model enables fast and scalable training over a long range spatial-temporal dependencies. Experiment results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves competitive results compared with the state-of-the-arts, especially forecasting long-term traffic flows on real-world PeMS-Bay and PeMSD7(M) datasets.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, in contrast to the existing CNN+RNN or pure 3D convolution based approaches, we explore a novel spatial temporal network (StNet) architecture for both local and global spatial-temporal modeling in videos. Particularly, StNet stacks N successive video frames into a \emph{super-image} which has 3N channels and applies 2D convolution on super-images to capture local spatial-temporal relationship. To model global spatial-temporal relationship, we apply temporal convolution on the local spatial-temporal feature maps. Specifically, a novel temporal Xception block is proposed in StNet. It employs a separate channel-wise and temporal-wise convolution over the feature sequence of video. Extensive experiments on the Kinetics dataset demonstrate that our framework outperforms several state-of-the-art approaches in action recognition and can strike a satisfying trade-off between recognition accuracy and model complexity. We further demonstrate the generalization performance of the leaned video representations on the UCF101 dataset.</p></details> | AAAI2019 |

Quite intuitively, pioneering two-stage based methods complete ST-VSR by directly combining two sub-tasks: Spatial Video Super-Resolution (S-VSR) and Temporal Video Super-Resolution(T-VSR) but ignore the reciprocal relations among them. Specifically, 1) T-VSR to S-VSR: temporal correlations help accurate spatial detail representation with more clues; 2) S-VSR to T-VSR: abundant spatial information contributes to the refinement of temporal prediction. To this end, we propose a one-stage based Cycle-projected Mutual learning network (CycMu-Net) for ST-VSR, which makes full use of spatial-temporal correlations via the mutual learning between S-VSR and T-VSR. Specifically, we propose to exploit the mutual information among them via iterative up-and-down projections, where the spatial and temporal features are fully fused and distilled, helping the high-quality video reconstruction. Besides extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, we also compare our proposed CycMu-Net with S-VSR and T-VSR tasks, demonstrating that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 10 pages, 8 figures |

However, most existing models are vulnerable to the quality of the generated region graph due to the inaccurate graph-structured information aggregation schema. The ubiquitous spatial-temporal data noise and incompleteness in real-life scenarios pose challenges in generating high-quality region representations. To address this challenge, we propose a new spatial-temporal graph learning model (GraphST) for enabling effective self-supervised learning. Our proposed model is an adversarial contrastive learning paradigm that automates the distillation of crucial multi-view self-supervised information for robust spatial-temporal graph augmentation. We empower GraphST to adaptively identify hard samples for better self-supervision, enhancing the representation discrimination ability and robustness. In addition, we introduce a cross-view contrastive learning paradigm to model the inter-dependencies across view-specific region representations and preserve underlying relation heterogeneity.

Although existing traffic prediction models often emphasize developing complex neural network structures, their accuracy has not improved. Recently, large language models have shown outstanding capabilities in time series analysis. Differing from existing models, LLMs progress mainly through parameter expansion and extensive pretraining while maintaining their fundamental structures. Motivated by these developments, we propose a Spatial-Temporal Large Language Model (ST-LLM) for traffic prediction. In the ST-LLM, we define timesteps at each location as tokens and design a spatial-temporal embedding to learn the spatial location and global temporal patterns of these tokens. Additionally, we integrate these embeddings by a fusion convolution to each token for a unified spatial-temporal representation. Furthermore, we innovate a partially frozen attention strategy to adapt the LLM to capture global spatial-temporal dependencies for traffic prediction. Comprehensive experiments on real traffic datasets offer evidence that ST-LLM is a powerful spatial-temporal learner that outperforms state-of-the-art models. Notably, the ST-LLM also exhibits robust performance in both few-shot and zero-shot prediction scenarios.

As external appearances of human emotions, electroencephalogram (EEG) signals and video face signals are widely used to track and analyze human's affective information. According to their common characteristics of spatial-temporal volumes, in this paper we propose a novel deep learning framework named spatial-temporal recurrent neural network (STRNN) to unify the learning of two different signal sources into a spatial-temporal dependency model. In STRNN, to capture those spatially cooccurrent variations of human emotions, a multi-directional recurrent neural network (RNN) layer is employed to capture longrange contextual cues by traversing the spatial region of each time slice from multiple angles. Then a bi-directional temporal RNN layer is further used to learn discriminative temporal dependencies from the sequences concatenating spatial features of each time slice produced from the spatial RNN layer. To further select those salient regions of emotion representation, we impose sparse projection onto those hidden states of spatial and temporal domains, which actually also increases the model discriminant ability because of this global consideration. Consequently, such a two-layer RNN model builds spatial dependencies as well as temporal dependencies of the input signals. Experimental results on the public emotion datasets of EEG and facial expression demonstrate the proposed STRNN method is more competitive over those state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

For instance, medical institutions often use electrodes attached to different parts of a patient to analyse the electorencephal data rich with spatial and temporal features for health assessment and disease diagnosis. Existing research has mainly used deep learning techniques such as convolutional neural network (CNN) or recurrent neural network (RNN) to extract hidden spatial-temporal features. Yet, it is challenging to incorporate both inter-dependencies spatial information and dynamic temporal changes simultaneously. In reality, for a model that leverages these spatial-temporal features to fulfil complex prediction tasks, it often requires a colossal amount of training data in order to obtain satisfactory model performance. Considering the above-mentioned challenges, we propose an adaptive federated relevance framework, namely FedRel, for spatial-temporal graph learning in this paper. After transforming the raw spatial-temporal data into high quality features, the core Dynamic Inter-Intra Graph (DIIG) module in the framework is able to use these features to generate the spatial-temporal graphs capable of capturing the hidden topological and long-term temporal correlation information in these graphs. To improve the model generalization ability and performance while preserving the local data privacy, we also design a relevance-driven federated learning module in our framework to leverage diverse data distributions from different participants with attentive aggregations of their models.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing methods focus on the modeling of spatial-temporal data in a single mode, lacking the understanding of multiple modes. Though very few methods have been presented to learn the multi-mode relationships recently, they are built on complicated components with higher model complexities. In this paper, we propose a simple framework for multi-mode spatial-temporal data modeling to bring both effectiveness and efficiency together. Specifically, we design a general cross-mode spatial relationships learning component to adaptively establish connections between multiple modes and propagate information along the learned connections. Moreover, we employ multi-layer perceptrons to capture the temporal dependencies and channel correlations, which are conceptually and technically succinct. Experiments on three real-world datasets show that our model can consistently outperform the baselines with lower space and time complexity, opening up a promising direction for modeling spatial-temporal data. The generalizability of the cross-mode spatial relationships learning module is also validated.</p></details> |  |

Traffic forecasting can be highly challenging due to complex spatial-temporal correlations and non-linear traffic patterns. Existing works mostly model such spatial-temporal dependencies by considering spatial correlations and temporal correlations separately and fail to model the direct spatial-temporal correlations. Inspired by the recent success of transformers in the graph domain, in this paper, we propose to directly model the cross-spatial-temporal correlations on the spatial-temporal graph using local multi-head self-attentions. To reduce the time complexity, we set the attention receptive field to the spatially neighboring nodes, and we also introduce an adaptive graph to capture the hidden spatial-temporal dependencies. Based on these attention mechanisms, we propose a novel Adaptive Graph Spatial-Temporal Transformer Network (ASTTN), which stacks multiple spatial-temporal attention layers to apply self-attention on the input graph, followed by linear layers for predictions. Experimental results on public traffic network datasets, METR-LA PEMS-BAY, PeMSD4, and PeMSD7, demonstrate the superior performance of our model.</p></details> |  |

The complex and long-range spatial-temporal correlations of traffic flow bring it to a most intractable challenge. Existing works typically utilize shallow graph convolution networks (GNNs) and temporal extracting modules to model spatial and temporal dependencies respectively. However, the representation ability of such models is limited due to: (1) shallow GNNs are incapable to capture long-range spatial correlations, (2) only spatial connections are considered and a mass of semantic connections are ignored, which are of great importance for a comprehensive understanding of traffic networks. To this end, we propose Spatial-Temporal Graph Ordinary Differential Equation Networks (STGODE). Specifically, we capture spatial-temporal dynamics through a tensor-based ordinary differential equation (ODE), as a result, deeper networks can be constructed and spatial-temporal features are utilized synchronously. To understand the network more comprehensively, semantical adjacency matrix is considered in our model, and a well-design temporal dialated convolution structure is used to capture long term temporal dependencies. We evaluate our model on multiple real-world traffic datasets and superior performance is achieved over state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  |

Most of the existing event prediction methods rely on temporal characteristics and are dedicated to exploring time series predictions, but ignoring the spatial relationship between hosts. This paper combines the temporal and spatial characteristics of security events and proposes a spatial-temporal event prediction model, named STEP. In particular, STEP formulates the security events prediction into a spatial-temporal sequence prediction. STEP utilizes graph convolution operation to capture the spatial characteristics of hosts in the network, and adopts the long short term memory (LSTM) to capture the dynamic temporal dependency of events. This paper verifies the proposed STEP scheme on two public data sets. The experimental results show that the prediction accuracy of security events under STEP is higher than that of benchmark models such as LSTM, ConvLSTM. Besides, STEP achieves high prediction accuracy when we predict events from different lengths of sequence.</p></details> |  |

The proposed method extends a causal inference approach by incorporating a spatial relation matrix that encodes interregional dependencies (e.g. proximity or connectivity), enabling spatially informed causal effect estimation. The resulting latent series are processed by deep probabilistic models to estimate the parameters of the distributions, enabling calibrated uncertainty modeling. We further explore multiple output distributions (e.g., Gaussian, Student's-$t$, Laplace) to capture region-specific variability. Experiments on COVID-19 data across six countries demonstrate that STOAT outperforms state-of-the-art probabilistic forecasting models (DeepAR, DeepVAR, Deep State Space Model, etc.) in key metrics, particularly in regions with strong spatial dependencies. By bridging causal inference and geospatial probabilistic forecasting, STOAT offers a generalizable framework for complex spatial-temporal tasks, such as epidemic management.</p></details> |  |
| **[A spatio-temporal LSTM model to forecast across multiple temporal and spatial scales](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.11875v1)** | 2021-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a novel spatio-temporal LSTM (SPATIAL) architecture for time series forecasting applied to environmental datasets. The framework was evaluated across multiple sensors and for three different oceanic variables: current speed, temperature, and dissolved oxygen. Network implementation proceeded in two directions that are nominally separated but connected as part of a natural environmental system -- across the spatial (between individual sensors) and temporal components of the sensor data. Data from four sensors sampling current speed, and eight measuring both temperature and dissolved oxygen evaluated the framework. Results were compared against RF and XGB baseline models that learned on the temporal signal of each sensor independently by extracting the date-time features together with the past history of data using sliding window matrix. Results demonstrated ability to accurately replicate complex signals and provide comparable performance to state-of-the-art benchmarks. Notably, the novel framework provided a simpler pre-processing and training pipeline that handles missing values via a simple masking layer. Enabling learning across the spatial and temporal directions, this paper addresses two fundamental challenges of ML applications to environmental science: 1) data sparsity and the challenges and costs of collecting measurements of environmental conditions such as ocean dynamics, and 2) environmental datasets are inherently connected in the spatial and temporal directions while classical ML approaches only consider one of these directions. Furthermore, sharing of parameters across all input steps makes SPATIAL a fast, scalable, and easily-parameterized forecasting framework.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatial-Temporal Transformer for 3D Point Cloud Sequences](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.09783v1)** | 2021-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effective learning of spatial-temporal information within a point cloud sequence is highly important for many down-stream tasks such as 4D semantic segmentation and 3D action recognition. In this paper, we propose a novel framework named Point Spatial-Temporal Transformer (PST2) to learn spatial-temporal representations from dynamic 3D point cloud sequences. Our PST2 consists of two major modules: a Spatio-Temporal Self-Attention (STSA) module and a Resolution Embedding (RE) module. Our STSA module is introduced to capture the spatial-temporal context information across adjacent frames, while the RE module is proposed to aggregate features across neighbors to enhance the resolution of feature maps. We test the effectiveness our PST2 with two different tasks on point cloud sequences, i.e., 4D semantic segmentation and 3D action recognition. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks show that our PST2 outperforms existing methods on all datasets. The effectiveness of our STSA and RE modules have also been justified with ablation experiments.</p></details> |  |

We propose a novel temporal/spatio-temporal Varying Coefficient Decision Process (VCDP) model, capable of effectively capturing the evolving treatment effects in situations characterized by temporal and/or spatial dependence. Our methodology encompasses the decomposition of the Average Treatment Effect (ATE) into the Direct Effect (DE) and the Indirect Effect (IE). We subsequently devise comprehensive procedures for estimating and making inferences about both DE and IE. Additionally, we provide a rigorous analysis of the statistical properties of these procedures, such as asymptotic power. To substantiate the effectiveness of our approach, we carry out extensive simulations and real data analyses.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatial-Temporal Self-Attention Network for Flow Prediction](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.07663v2)** | 2019-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Flow prediction (e.g., crowd flow, traffic flow) with features of spatial-temporal is increasingly investigated in AI research field. It is very challenging due to the complicated spatial dependencies between different locations and dynamic temporal dependencies among different time intervals. Although measurements of both dependencies are employed, existing methods suffer from the following two problems. First, the temporal dependencies are measured either uniformly or bias against long-term dependencies, which overlooks the distinctive impacts of short-term and long-term temporal dependencies. Second, the existing methods capture spatial and temporal dependencies independently, which wrongly assumes that the correlations between these dependencies are weak and ignores the complicated mutual influences between them. To address these issues, we propose a Spatial-Temporal Self-Attention Network (ST-SAN). As the path-length of attending long-term dependency is shorter in the self-attention mechanism, the vanishing of long-term temporal dependencies is prevented. In addition, since our model relies solely on attention mechanisms, the spatial and temporal dependencies can be simultaneously measured. Experimental results on real-world data demonstrate that, in comparison with state-of-the-art methods, our model reduces the root mean square errors by 9% in inflow prediction and 4% in outflow prediction on Taxi-NYC data, which is very significant compared to the previous improvement.</p></details> | 8 pages |
| **[Interpretable Crowd Flow Prediction with Spatial-Temporal Self-Attention](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.09693v1)** | 2020-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Crowd flow prediction has been increasingly investigated in intelligent urban computing field as a fundamental component of urban management system. The most challenging part of predicting crowd flow is to measure the complicated spatial-temporal dependencies. A prevalent solution employed in current methods is to divide and conquer the spatial and temporal information by various architectures (e.g., CNN/GCN, LSTM). However, this strategy has two disadvantages: (1) the sophisticated dependencies are also divided and therefore partially isolated; (2) the spatial-temporal features are transformed into latent representations when passing through different architectures, making it hard to interpret the predicted crowd flow. To address these issues, we propose a Spatial-Temporal Self-Attention Network (STSAN) with an ST encoding gate that calculates the entire spatial-temporal representation with positional and time encodings and therefore avoids dividing the dependencies. Furthermore, we develop a Multi-aspect attention mechanism that applies scaled dot-product attention over spatial-temporal information and measures the attention weights that explicitly indicate the dependencies. Experimental results on traffic and mobile data demonstrate that the proposed method reduces inflow and outflow RMSE by 16% and 8% on the Taxi-NYC dataset compared to the SOTA baselines.</p></details> | 7pages |

However, previous methods either model spatial and temporal information separately, or directly aggregate individual features to form group features. To address these issues, we propose a novel group activity recognition network termed GroupFormer. It captures spatial-temporal contextual information jointly to augment the individual and group representations effectively with a clustered spatial-temporal transformer. Specifically, our GroupFormer has three appealing advantages: (1) A tailor-modified Transformer, Clustered Spatial-Temporal Transformer, is proposed to enhance the individual representation and group representation. (2) It models the spatial and temporal dependencies integrally and utilizes decoders to build the bridge between the spatial and temporal information. (3) A clustered attention mechanism is utilized to dynamically divide individuals into multiple clusters for better learning activity-aware semantic representations. Moreover, experimental results show that the proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the Volleyball dataset and Collective Activity dataset.

While it is well known that spatial chemotaxis becomes disadvantageous for small organisms at high noise levels, it is unclear whether there is a discontinuous switch of optimal strategies or a continuous transition exists. Here, we employ deep reinforcement learning to study the possible integration of spatial and temporal information in an a priori unconstrained manner. We parameterize such a combined chemotactic policy by a recurrent neural network and evaluate it using a minimal theoretical model of a chemotactic cell. By comparing with constrained variants of the policy, we show that it converges to purely temporal and spatial strategies at small and large cell sizes, respectively. We find that the transition between the regimes is continuous, with the combined strategy outperforming in the transition region both the constrained variants as well as models that explicitly integrate spatial and temporal information. Finally, by utilizing the attribution method of integrated gradients, we show that the policy relies on a non-trivial combination of spatially and temporally derived gradient information in a ratio that varies dynamically during the chemotactic trajectories.</p></details> |  |

| **[Geo-Spatial Cluster based Hybrid Spatio-Temporal Copula Interpolation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.14285v1)** | 2022-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the absence of Gaussianity assumptions without disturbing spatial continuity interpolating along the whole spatial surface for different time lags is challenging. The past researchers pay enough attention to Spatio-temporal interpolation ignoring the dynamic behavior of a spatial mean function, threshold distance, and direction of maintaining spatial continuity. Therefore, we employ hierarchical spatial clustering (HSC) to preserve local spatial stationarity. This research work introduces a hybrid extreme valued copula-based Spatio-temporal interpolation algorithm. Spatial dependence is captured by a blended extreme valued probability distribution (BEVD). Temporal dependency is modeled by the Bi-directional long short-time memory (BLSTM) at different temporal granularities, 1 month, 2 months, and 3 months. Spatio-temporal dependence is modeled by the Gumbel-Hougaard copula (GH). We apply the proposed Spatio-temporal interpolation approach to the air pollution data (Outdoor Particulate Matter (PM) concentration) of Delhi, collected from the website of the Central Pollution Control Board, India as a crucial circumstantial study. This article describes a probabilistic-recurrent neural networking algorithm for Spatio-temporal interpolation. This Spatio-temporal hybrid copula interpolation algorithm outperforms and is efficient enough to detect spatial trends and temporal influence. From the entire research, we notice that PM concentration in a year reaches a maximum, generally in November and December. The northern and central part of Del-hi is the most sensitive regarding air pollution.</p></details> |  |

Due to their importance, a large body of work has focused on efficiently computing various spatial keyword queries. In this paper,we study the top-$k$ temporal spatial keyword query which considers three important constraints during the search including time, spatial proximity and textual relevance. A novel index structure, namely SSG-tree, to efficiently insert/delete spatio-temporal web objects with high rates. Base on SSG-tree an efficient algorithm is developed to support top-k temporal spatial keyword query. We show via extensive experimentation with real spatial databases that our method has increased performance over alternate techniques</p></details> |  |
| **[Revisiting the Spatial and Temporal Modeling for Few-shot Action Recognition](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.07944v2)** | 2023-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial and temporal modeling is one of the most core aspects of few-shot action recognition. Most previous works mainly focus on long-term temporal relation modeling based on high-level spatial representations, without considering the crucial low-level spatial features and short-term temporal relations. Actually, the former feature could bring rich local semantic information, and the latter feature could represent motion characteristics of adjacent frames, respectively. In this paper, we propose SloshNet, a new framework that revisits the spatial and temporal modeling for few-shot action recognition in a finer manner. First, to exploit the low-level spatial features, we design a feature fusion architecture search module to automatically search for the best combination of the low-level and high-level spatial features. Next, inspired by the recent transformer, we introduce a long-term temporal modeling module to model the global temporal relations based on the extracted spatial appearance features. Meanwhile, we design another short-term temporal modeling module to encode the motion characteristics between adjacent frame representations. After that, the final predictions can be obtained by feeding the embedded rich spatial-temporal features to a common frame-level class prototype matcher. We extensively validate the proposed SloshNet on four few-shot action recognition datasets, including Something-Something V2, Kinetics, UCF101, and HMDB51. It achieves favorable results against state-of-the-art methods in all datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatial-Temporal Fusion Graph Neural Networks for Traffic Flow Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.09641v2)** | 2021-03-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial-temporal data forecasting of traffic flow is a challenging task because of complicated spatial dependencies and dynamical trends of temporal pattern between different roads. Existing frameworks typically utilize given spatial adjacency graph and sophisticated mechanisms for modeling spatial and temporal correlations. However, limited representations of given spatial graph structure with incomplete adjacent connections may restrict effective spatial-temporal dependencies learning of those models. To overcome those limitations, our paper proposes Spatial-Temporal Fusion Graph Neural Networks (STFGNN) for traffic flow forecasting. SFTGNN could effectively learn hidden spatial-temporal dependencies by a novel fusion operation of various spatial and temporal graphs, which is generated by a data-driven method. Meanwhile, by integrating this fusion graph module and a novel gated convolution module into a unified layer, SFTGNN could handle long sequences. Experimental results on several public traffic datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance consistently than other baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures, to be published in AAAI2021. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1903.00919 by other authors</p></details> |

Spatial and temporal distractors in person videos, such as background clutter and partial occlusions over frames, respectively, make this task much more challenging than image-based person reID. We observe that spatial distractors appear consistently in a particular location, and temporal distractors show several patterns, e.g., partial occlusions occur in the first few frames, where such patterns provide informative cues for predicting which frames to focus on (i.e., temporal attentions). Based on this, we introduce a novel Spatial and Temporal Memory Networks (STMN). The spatial memory stores features for spatial distractors that frequently emerge across video frames, while the temporal memory saves attentions which are optimized for typical temporal patterns in person videos. We leverage the spatial and temporal memories to refine frame-level person representations and to aggregate the refined frame-level features into a sequence-level person representation, respectively, effectively handling spatial and temporal distractors in person videos. We also introduce a memory spread loss preventing our model from addressing particular items only in the memories. Experimental results on standard benchmarks, including MARS, DukeMTMC-VideoReID, and LS-VID, demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Inter...</summary><p>International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV) 2021</p></details> |

| **[Understanding the Spatial and Temporal Activity Patterns of Subway Mobility Flows](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1702.02456v2)** | 2017-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In urban transportation systems, mobility flows in the subway system reflect the spatial and temporal dynamics of working days. To investigate the variability of mobility flows, we analyse the spatial community through a series of snapshots of subway stations over sequential periods. Using Shanghai as a case study, we find that the spatial community snapshots reveal dynamic passenger activities. Adopting a dual-perspective, we apply spatial and temporal models separately to explore where and when individuals travel for entertainment. In the two models, microblog topics and spatial facilities such as food venues and entertainment businesses are used to characterise the spatial popularity of each station and people's travelling perceptions. In the studied case, the city centre is characterised by greater social influence, and it is better described by the spatial model. In the temporal model, shorter travel distances motivate individuals to start their trips earlier. Interestingly, as the number of food-related facilities near the starting station increases, until it exceeds 1563, the speed of people's journeys slows down. This study provides a method for modelling the effects of social features on mobility flows and for predicting the spatial-temporal mobility flows of newly built subway stations.</p></details> |  |

These representations have been learned in a self-supervised fashion from unlabeled images or videos, using carefully designed pretext tasks in some recent studies. However, the previous work concentrates on either spatial-discriminative features or temporal-repetitive features, with little attention to the synergy between spatial and temporal cues. To address this issue, we propose a spatial-then-temporal self-supervised learning method. Specifically, we firstly extract spatial features from unlabeled images via contrastive learning, and secondly enhance the features by exploiting the temporal cues in unlabeled videos via reconstructive learning. In the second step, we design a global correlation distillation loss to ensure the learning not to forget the spatial cues, and a local correlation distillation loss to combat the temporal discontinuity that harms the reconstruction. The proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art self-supervised methods, as established by the experimental results on a series of correspondence-based video analysis tasks. Also, we performed ablation studies to verify the effectiveness of the two-step design as well as the distillation losses.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2023.

Recently, graph convolutional networks (GCNs) have been widely used in traffic flow prediction owing to their powerful ability to capture spatial-temporal dependencies. The design of the spatial-temporal graph adjacency matrix is a key to the success of GCNs, and it is still an open question. This paper proposes reconstructing the binary adjacency matrix via tensor decomposition, and a traffic flow forecasting method is proposed. First, we reformulate the spatial-temporal fusion graph adjacency matrix into a three-way adjacency tensor. Then, we reconstructed the adjacency tensor via Tucker decomposition, wherein more informative and global spatial-temporal dependencies are encoded. Finally, a Spatial-temporal Synchronous Graph Convolutional module for localized spatial-temporal correlations learning and a Dilated Convolution module for global correlations learning are assembled to aggregate and learn the comprehensive spatial-temporal dependencies of the road network. Experimental results on four open-access datasets demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of the prediction performance and computational cost.</p></details> | 11 pages, 8 figures |

With the diversification of data sources, reasonably using rich traffic data to model the complex spatial-temporal dependence and nonlinear characteristics in traffic flow are the key challenge for intelligent transportation system. In addition, clearly evaluating the importance of spatial-temporal features extracted from different data becomes a challenge. A Double Layer - Spatial Temporal Feature Extraction and Evaluation (DL-STFEE) model is proposed. The lower layer of DL-STFEE is spatial-temporal feature extraction layer. The spatial and temporal features in traffic data are extracted by multi-graph graph convolution and attention mechanism, and different combinations of spatial and temporal features are generated. The upper layer of DL-STFEE is the spatial-temporal feature evaluation layer. Through the attention score matrix generated by the high-dimensional self-attention mechanism, the spatial-temporal features combinations are fused and evaluated, so as to get the impact of different combinations on prediction effect. Three sets of experiments are performed on actual traffic datasets to show that DL-STFEE can effectively capture the spatial-temporal features and evaluate the importance of different spatial-temporal feature combinations.</p></details> | <details><summary>39 pa...</summary><p>39 pages, 14 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

However, they do not address the issues of sufficient target interaction and efficient parallel processing simultaneously, thereby constraining the learning of dynamic, target-aware features. To tackle these limitations, this paper proposes a spatial-temporal multi-level association framework, which jointly associates reference frame, test frame, and object features to achieve sufficient interaction and parallel target ID association with a spatial-temporal memory bank for efficient video object segmentation. Specifically, we construct a spatial-temporal multi-level feature association module to learn better target-aware features, which formulates feature extraction and interaction as the efficient operations of object self-attention, reference object enhancement, and test reference correlation. In addition, we propose a spatial-temporal memory to assist feature association and temporal ID assignment and correlation. We evaluate the proposed method by conducting extensive experiments on numerous video object segmentation datasets, including DAVIS 2016/2017 val, DAVIS 2017 test-dev, and YouTube-VOS 2018/2019 val. The favorable performance against the state-of-the-art methods demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach. All source code and trained models will be made publicly available.</p></details> |  |

The complex and dynamic spatial-temporal dependencies make the traffic flow prediction quite challenging. Although existing spatial-temporal graph neural networks hold prominent, they often encounter challenges such as (1) ignoring the fixed graph that limits the predictive performance of the model, (2) insufficiently capturing complex spatial-temporal dependencies simultaneously, and (3) lacking attention to spatial-temporal information at different time lengths. In this paper, we propose a Multi-Scale Spatial-Temporal Recurrent Network for traffic flow prediction, namely MSSTRN, which consists of two different recurrent neural networks: the single-step gate recurrent unit and the multi-step gate recurrent unit to fully capture the complex spatial-temporal information in the traffic data under different time windows. Moreover, we propose a spatial-temporal synchronous attention mechanism that integrates adaptive position graph convolutions into the self-attention mechanism to achieve synchronous capture of spatial-temporal dependencies. We conducted extensive experiments on four real traffic datasets and demonstrated that our model achieves the best prediction accuracy with non-trivial margins compared to all the twenty baseline methods.</p></details> |  |

While much progress has been made in analyzing and improving the robustness of models in image understanding, the robustness in video understanding is largely unexplored. In this paper, we establish a corruption robustness benchmark, Mini Kinetics-C and Mini SSV2-C, which considers temporal corruptions beyond spatial corruptions in images. We make the first attempt to conduct an exhaustive study on the corruption robustness of established CNN-based and Transformer-based spatial-temporal models. The study provides some guidance on robust model design and training: Transformer-based model performs better than CNN-based models on corruption robustness; the generalization ability of spatial-temporal models implies robustness against temporal corruptions; model corruption robustness (especially robustness in the temporal domain) enhances with computational cost and model capacity, which may contradict the current trend of improving the computational efficiency of models. Moreover, we find the robustness intervention for image-related tasks (e.g., training models with noise) may not work for spatial-temporal models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPs 2021 Dataset and Benchmark Track.

Previous methods usually quantize the entire body pose into one code, which not only faces the difficulty in encoding all joints within one vector but also loses the spatial relationship between different joints. Differently, in this work we quantize each individual joint into one vector, which i) simplifies the quantization process as the complexity associated with a single joint is markedly lower than that of the entire pose; ii) maintains a spatial-temporal structure that preserves both the spatial relationships among joints and the temporal movement patterns; iii) yields a 2D token map, which enables the application of various 2D operations widely used in 2D images. Grounded in the 2D motion quantization, we build a spatial-temporal modeling framework, where 2D joint VQVAE, temporal-spatial 2D masking technique, and spatial-temporal 2D attention are proposed to take advantage of spatial-temporal signals among the 2D tokens. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms previous methods across different datasets, with a 26.6% decrease of FID on HumanML3D and a 29.9% decrease on KIT-ML.

| **[FedASTA: Federated adaptive spatial-temporal attention for traffic flow prediction](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.13090v2)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mobile devices and the Internet of Things (IoT) devices nowadays generate a large amount of heterogeneous spatial-temporal data. It remains a challenging problem to model the spatial-temporal dynamics under privacy concern. Federated learning (FL) has been proposed as a framework to enable model training across distributed devices without sharing original data which reduce privacy concern. Personalized federated learning (PFL) methods further address data heterogenous problem. However, these methods don't consider natural spatial relations among nodes. For the sake of modeling spatial relations, Graph Neural Netowork (GNN) based FL approach have been proposed. But dynamic spatial-temporal relations among edge nodes are not taken into account. Several approaches model spatial-temporal dynamics in a centralized environment, while less effort has been made under federated setting. To overcome these challeges, we propose a novel Federated Adaptive Spatial-Temporal Attention (FedASTA) framework to model the dynamic spatial-temporal relations. On the client node, FedASTA extracts temporal relations and trend patterns from the decomposed terms of original time series. Then, on the server node, FedASTA utilize trend patterns from clients to construct adaptive temporal-spatial aware graph which captures dynamic correlation between clients. Besides, we design a masked spatial attention module with both static graph and constructed adaptive graph to model spatial dependencies among clients. Extensive experiments on five real-world public traffic flow datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-art performance in federated scenario. In addition, the experiments made in centralized setting show the effectiveness of our novel adaptive graph construction approach compared with other popular dynamic spatial-temporal aware methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[ST-FiT: Inductive Spatial-Temporal Forecasting with Limited Training Data](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.10912v2)** | 2024-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial-temporal graphs are widely used in a variety of real-world applications. Spatial-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (STGNNs) have emerged as a powerful tool to extract meaningful insights from this data. However, in real-world applications, most nodes may not possess any available temporal data during training. For example, the pandemic dynamics of most cities on a geographical graph may not be available due to the asynchronous nature of outbreaks. Such a phenomenon disagrees with the training requirements of most existing spatial-temporal forecasting methods, which jeopardizes their effectiveness and thus blocks broader deployment. In this paper, we propose to formulate a novel problem of inductive forecasting with limited training data. In particular, given a spatial-temporal graph, we aim to learn a spatial-temporal forecasting model that can be easily generalized onto those nodes without any available temporal training data. To handle this problem, we propose a principled framework named ST-FiT. ST-FiT consists of two key learning components: temporal data augmentation and spatial graph topology learning. With such a design, ST-FiT can be used on top of any existing STGNNs to achieve superior performance on the nodes without training data. Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness of ST-FiT in multiple key perspectives.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Joint Spatial-Temporal Transformations for Video Inpainting](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.10247v1)** | 2020-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-quality video inpainting that completes missing regions in video frames is a promising yet challenging task. State-of-the-art approaches adopt attention models to complete a frame by searching missing contents from reference frames, and further complete whole videos frame by frame. However, these approaches can suffer from inconsistent attention results along spatial and temporal dimensions, which often leads to blurriness and temporal artifacts in videos. In this paper, we propose to learn a joint Spatial-Temporal Transformer Network (STTN) for video inpainting. Specifically, we simultaneously fill missing regions in all input frames by self-attention, and propose to optimize STTN by a spatial-temporal adversarial loss. To show the superiority of the proposed model, we conduct both quantitative and qualitative evaluations by using standard stationary masks and more realistic moving object masks. Demo videos are available at https://github.com/researchmm/STTN.</p></details> | Accepted by ECCV2020 |
| **[How Can Large Language Models Understand Spatial-Temporal Data?](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.14192v2)** | 2024-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Large Language Models (LLMs) dominate tasks like natural language processing and computer vision, harnessing their power for spatial-temporal forecasting remains challenging. The disparity between sequential text and complex spatial-temporal data hinders this application. To address this issue, this paper introduces STG-LLM, an innovative approach empowering LLMs for spatial-temporal forecasting. We tackle the data mismatch by proposing: 1) STG-Tokenizer: This spatial-temporal graph tokenizer transforms intricate graph data into concise tokens capturing both spatial and temporal relationships; 2) STG-Adapter: This minimalistic adapter, consisting of linear encoding and decoding layers, bridges the gap between tokenized data and LLM comprehension. By fine-tuning only a small set of parameters, it can effectively grasp the semantics of tokens generated by STG-Tokenizer, while preserving the original natural language understanding capabilities of LLMs. Extensive experiments on diverse spatial-temporal benchmark datasets show that STG-LLM successfully unlocks LLM potential for spatial-temporal forecasting. Remarkably, our approach achieves competitive performance on par with dedicated SOTA methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reconciling Spatial and Temporal Abstractions for Goal Representation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.09870v2)** | 2024-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Goal representation affects the performance of Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL) algorithms by decomposing the complex learning problem into easier subtasks. Recent studies show that representations that preserve temporally abstract environment dynamics are successful in solving difficult problems and provide theoretical guarantees for optimality. These methods however cannot scale to tasks where environment dynamics increase in complexity i.e. the temporally abstract transition relations depend on larger number of variables. On the other hand, other efforts have tried to use spatial abstraction to mitigate the previous issues. Their limitations include scalability to high dimensional environments and dependency on prior knowledge. In this paper, we propose a novel three-layer HRL algorithm that introduces, at different levels of the hierarchy, both a spatial and a temporal goal abstraction. We provide a theoretical study of the regret bounds of the learned policies. We evaluate the approach on complex continuous control tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of spatial and temporal abstractions learned by this approach.

| **[Graph WaveNet for Deep Spatial-Temporal Graph Modeling](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.00121v1)** | 2019-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial-temporal graph modeling is an important task to analyze the spatial relations and temporal trends of components in a system. Existing approaches mostly capture the spatial dependency on a fixed graph structure, assuming that the underlying relation between entities is pre-determined. However, the explicit graph structure (relation) does not necessarily reflect the true dependency and genuine relation may be missing due to the incomplete connections in the data. Furthermore, existing methods are ineffective to capture the temporal trends as the RNNs or CNNs employed in these methods cannot capture long-range temporal sequences. To overcome these limitations, we propose in this paper a novel graph neural network architecture, Graph WaveNet, for spatial-temporal graph modeling. By developing a novel adaptive dependency matrix and learn it through node embedding, our model can precisely capture the hidden spatial dependency in the data. With a stacked dilated 1D convolution component whose receptive field grows exponentially as the number of layers increases, Graph WaveNet is able to handle very long sequences. These two components are integrated seamlessly in a unified framework and the whole framework is learned in an end-to-end manner. Experimental results on two public traffic network datasets, METR-LA and PEMS-BAY, demonstrate the superior performance of our algorithm.</p></details> | <details><summary>to be...</summary><p>to be published in IJCAI-2019</p></details> |
| **[Spatial-Temporal Transformer based Video Compression Framework](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.11913v1)** | 2023-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learned video compression (LVC) has witnessed remarkable advancements in recent years. Similar as the traditional video coding, LVC inherits motion estimation/compensation, residual coding and other modules, all of which are implemented with neural networks (NNs). However, within the framework of NNs and its training mechanism using gradient backpropagation, most existing works often struggle to consistently generate stable motion information, which is in the form of geometric features, from the input color features. Moreover, the modules such as the inter-prediction and residual coding are independent from each other, making it inefficient to fully reduce the spatial-temporal redundancy. To address the above problems, in this paper, we propose a novel Spatial-Temporal Transformer based Video Compression (STT-VC) framework. It contains a Relaxed Deformable Transformer (RDT) with Uformer based offsets estimation for motion estimation and compensation, a Multi-Granularity Prediction (MGP) module based on multi-reference frames for prediction refinement, and a Spatial Feature Distribution prior based Transformer (SFD-T) for efficient temporal-spatial joint residual compression. Specifically, RDT is developed to stably estimate the motion information between frames by thoroughly investigating the relationship between the similarity based geometric motion feature extraction and self-attention. MGP is designed to fuse the multi-reference frame information by effectively exploring the coarse-grained prediction feature generated with the coded motion information. SFD-T is to compress the residual information by jointly exploring the spatial feature distributions in both residual and temporal prediction to further reduce the spatial-temporal redundancy. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves the best result with 13.5% BD-Rate saving over VTM.</p></details> |  |
| **[Survey of Federated Learning Models for Spatial-Temporal Mobility Applications](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.05257v4)** | 2024-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated learning involves training statistical models over edge devices such as mobile phones such that the training data is kept local. Federated Learning (FL) can serve as an ideal candidate for training spatial temporal models that rely on heterogeneous and potentially massive numbers of participants while preserving the privacy of highly sensitive location data. However, there are unique challenges involved with transitioning existing spatial temporal models to decentralized learning. In this survey paper, we review the existing literature that has proposed FL-based models for predicting human mobility, traffic prediction, community detection, location-based recommendation systems, and other spatial-temporal tasks. We describe the metrics and datasets these works have been using and create a baseline of these approaches in comparison to the centralized settings. Finally, we discuss the challenges of applying spatial-temporal models in a decentralized setting and by highlighting the gaps in the literature we provide a road map and opportunities for the research community.</p></details> |  |

Compared to the task of scene graph generation from images, it is more challenging because of the dynamic relationships between objects and the temporal dependencies between frames allowing for a richer semantic interpretation. In this paper, we propose Spatial-temporal Transformer (STTran), a neural network that consists of two core modules: (1) a spatial encoder that takes an input frame to extract spatial context and reason about the visual relationships within a frame, and (2) a temporal decoder which takes the output of the spatial encoder as input in order to capture the temporal dependencies between frames and infer the dynamic relationships. Furthermore, STTran is flexible to take varying lengths of videos as input without clipping, which is especially important for long videos. Our method is validated on the benchmark dataset Action Genome (AG). The experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of our method in terms of dynamic scene graphs. Moreover, a set of ablative studies is conducted and the effect of each proposed module is justified.

| **[Effect of Spatial and Temporal Traffic Statistics on the Performance of Wireless Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.06754v3)** | 2020-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The traffic in wireless networks has become diverse and fluctuating both spatially and temporally due to the emergence of new wireless applications and the complexity of scenarios. The purpose of this paper is to quantitatively analyze the impact of the wireless traffic, which fluctuates both spatially and temporally, on the performance of the wireless networks. Specially, we propose to combine the tools from stochastic geometry and queueing theory to model the spatial and temporal fluctuation of traffic, which to our best knowledge has seldom been evaluated analytically. We derive the spatial and temporal statistics, the total arrival rate, the stability of queues and the delay of users by considering two different spatial properties of traffic, i.e., the uniformly and non-uniformly distributed cases. The numerical results indicate that although the fluctuation of traffic (reflected by the variance of total arrival rate) when the users are clustered is much fiercer than that when the users are uniformly distributed, the unstable probability is smaller. Our work provides a useful reference for the design of wireless networks when the complex spatio-temporal fluctuation of the traffic is considered.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted in Transactions on Communications</p></details> |
| **[STSA: Spatial-Temporal Semantic Alignment for Visual Dubbing](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.23039v1)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing audio-driven visual dubbing methods have achieved great success. Despite this, we observe that the semantic ambiguity between spatial and temporal domains significantly degrades the synthesis stability for the dynamic faces. We argue that aligning the semantic features from spatial and temporal domains is a promising approach to stabilizing facial motion. To achieve this, we propose a Spatial-Temporal Semantic Alignment (STSA) method, which introduces a dual-path alignment mechanism and a differentiable semantic representation. The former leverages a Consistent Information Learning (CIL) module to maximize the mutual information at multiple scales, thereby reducing the manifold differences between spatial and temporal domains. The latter utilizes probabilistic heatmap as ambiguity-tolerant guidance to avoid the abnormal dynamics of the synthesized faces caused by slight semantic jittering. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed STSA, especially in terms of image quality and synthesis stability.

| **[Spatial-Temporal Hypergraph Neural Network for Traffic Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.16070v1)** | 2023-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic forecasting, which benefits from mobile Internet development and position technologies, plays a critical role in Intelligent Transportation Systems. It helps to implement rich and varied transportation applications and bring convenient transportation services to people based on collected traffic data. Most existing methods usually leverage graph-based deep learning networks to model the complex road network for traffic forecasting shallowly. Despite their effectiveness, these methods are generally limited in fully capturing high-order spatial dependencies caused by road network topology and high-order temporal dependencies caused by traffic dynamics. To tackle the above issues, we focus on the essence of traffic system and propose STHODE: Spatio-Temporal Hypergraph Neural Ordinary Differential Equation Network, which combines road network topology and traffic dynamics to capture high-order spatio-temporal dependencies in traffic data. Technically, STHODE consists of a spatial module and a temporal module. On the one hand, we construct a spatial hypergraph and leverage an adaptive MixHop hypergraph ODE network to capture high-order spatial dependencies. On the other hand, we utilize a temporal hypergraph and employ a hyperedge evolving ODE network to capture high-order temporal dependencies. Finally, we aggregate the outputs of stacked STHODE layers to mutually enhance the prediction performance. Extensive experiments conducted on four real-world traffic datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed model compared to various baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[FRK: An R Package for Spatial and Spatio-Temporal Prediction with Large Datasets](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.08105v3)** | 2018-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>FRK is an R software package for spatial/spatio-temporal modelling and prediction with large datasets. It facilitates optimal spatial prediction (kriging) on the most commonly used manifolds (in Euclidean space and on the surface of the sphere), for both spatial and spatio-temporal fields. It differs from many of the packages for spatial modelling and prediction by avoiding stationary and isotropic covariance and variogram models, instead constructing a spatial random effects (SRE) model on a fine-resolution discretised spatial domain. The discrete element is known as a basic areal unit (BAU), whose introduction in the software leads to several practical advantages. The software can be used to (i) integrate multiple observations with different supports with relative ease; (ii) obtain exact predictions at millions of prediction locations (without conditional simulation); and (iii) distinguish between measurement error and fine-scale variation at the resolution of the BAU, thereby allowing for reliable uncertainty quantification. The temporal component is included by adding another dimension. A key component of the SRE model is the specification of spatial or spatio-temporal basis functions; in the package, they can be generated automatically or by the user. The package also offers automatic BAU construction, an expectation-maximisation (EM) algorithm for parameter estimation, and functionality for prediction over any user-specified polygons or BAUs. Use of the package is illustrated on several spatial and spatio-temporal datasets, and its predictions and the model it implements are extensively compared to others commonly used for spatial prediction and modelling.</p></details> | 44 pages, 22 figures |
| **[Spatial-temporal Forecasting for Regions without Observations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.10518v1)** | 2024-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial-temporal forecasting plays an important role in many real-world applications, such as traffic forecasting, air pollutant forecasting, crowd-flow forecasting, and so on. State-of-the-art spatial-temporal forecasting models take data-driven approaches and rely heavily on data availability. Such models suffer from accuracy issues when data is incomplete, which is common in reality due to the heavy costs of deploying and maintaining sensors for data collection. A few recent studies attempted to address the issue of incomplete data. They typically assume some data availability in a region of interest either for a short period or at a few locations. In this paper, we further study spatial-temporal forecasting for a region of interest without any historical observations, to address scenarios such as unbalanced region development, progressive deployment of sensors or lack of open data. We propose a model named STSM for the task. The model takes a contrastive learning-based approach to learn spatial-temporal patterns from adjacent regions that have recorded data. Our key insight is to learn from the locations that resemble those in the region of interest, and we propose a selective masking strategy to enable the learning. As a result, our model outperforms adapted state-of-the-art models, reducing errors consistently over both traffic and air pollutant forecasting tasks.

| **[Progressive Cross-Stream Cooperation in Spatial and Temporal Domain for Action Localization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.11575v2)** | 2025-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal action localization consists of three levels of tasks: spatial localization, action classification, and temporal localization. In this work, we propose a new progressive cross-stream cooperation (PCSC) framework that improves all three tasks above. The basic idea is to utilize both spatial region (resp., temporal segment proposals) and features from one stream (i.e., the Flow/RGB stream) to help another stream (i.e., the RGB/Flow stream) to iteratively generate better bounding boxes in the spatial domain (resp., temporal segments in the temporal domain). In this way, not only the actions could be more accurately localized both spatially and temporally, but also the action classes could be predicted more precisely. Specifically, we first combine the latest region proposals (for spatial detection) or segment proposals (for temporal localization) from both streams to form a larger set of labelled training samples to help learn better action detection or segment detection models. Second, to learn better representations, we also propose a new message passing approach to pass information from one stream to another stream, which also leads to better action detection and segment detection models. By first using our newly proposed PCSC framework for spatial localization at the frame-level and then applying our temporal PCSC framework for temporal localization at the tube-level, the action localization results are progressively improved at both the frame level and the video level. Comprehensive experiments on two benchmark datasets UCF-101-24 and J-HMDB demonstrate the effectiveness of our newly proposed approaches for spatio-temporal action localization in realistic scenarios.</p></details> | TPAMI |

Better combination and use of multi-level features with time information can greatly improve the accuracy of the video saliency model. In order to fully combine multi-level features and make it serve the video saliency model, we propose a 3D fully convolutional encoder-decoder architecture for video saliency detection, which combines scale, space and time information for video saliency modeling. The encoder extracts multi-scale temporal-spatial features from the input continuous video frames, and then constructs temporal-spatial feature pyramid through temporal-spatial convolution and top-down feature integration. The decoder performs hierarchical decoding of temporal-spatial features from different scales, and finally produces a saliency map from the integration of multiple video frames. Our model is simple yet effective, and can run in real time. We perform abundant experiments, and the results indicate that the well-designed structure can improve the precision of video saliency detection significantly. Experimental results on three purely visual video saliency benchmarks and six audio-video saliency benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[ST-USleepNet: A Spatial-Temporal Coupling Prominence Network for Multi-Channel Sleep Staging](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.11884v3)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sleep staging is critical to assess sleep quality and diagnose disorders. Despite advancements in artificial intelligence enabling automated sleep staging, significant challenges remain: (1) Simultaneously extracting prominent temporal and spatial sleep features from multi-channel raw signals, including characteristic sleep waveforms and salient spatial brain networks. (2) Capturing the spatial-temporal coupling patterns essential for accurate sleep staging. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework named ST-USleepNet, comprising a spatial-temporal graph construction module (ST) and a U-shaped sleep network (USleepNet). The ST module converts raw signals into a spatial-temporal graph based on signal similarity, temporal, and spatial relationships to model spatial-temporal coupling patterns. The USleepNet employs a U-shaped structure for both the temporal and spatial streams, mirroring its original use in image segmentation to isolate significant targets. Applied to raw sleep signals and graph data from the ST module, USleepNet effectively segments these inputs, simultaneously extracting prominent temporal and spatial sleep features. Testing on three datasets demonstrates that ST-USleepNet outperforms existing baselines, and model visualizations confirm its efficacy in extracting prominent sleep features and temporal-spatial coupling patterns across various sleep stages.

| **[Revisiting Spatial-Temporal Similarity: A Deep Learning Framework for Traffic Prediction](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.01254v2)** | 2018-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic prediction has drawn increasing attention in AI research field due to the increasing availability of large-scale traffic data and its importance in the real world. For example, an accurate taxi demand prediction can assist taxi companies in pre-allocating taxis. The key challenge of traffic prediction lies in how to model the complex spatial dependencies and temporal dynamics. Although both factors have been considered in modeling, existing works make strong assumptions about spatial dependence and temporal dynamics, i.e., spatial dependence is stationary in time, and temporal dynamics is strictly periodical. However, in practice, the spatial dependence could be dynamic (i.e., changing from time to time), and the temporal dynamics could have some perturbation from one period to another period. In this paper, we make two important observations: (1) the spatial dependencies between locations are dynamic; and (2) the temporal dependency follows daily and weekly pattern but it is not strictly periodic for its dynamic temporal shifting. To address these two issues, we propose a novel Spatial-Temporal Dynamic Network (STDN), in which a flow gating mechanism is introduced to learn the dynamic similarity between locations, and a periodically shifted attention mechanism is designed to handle long-term periodic temporal shifting. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that tackles both issues in a unified framework. Our experimental results on real-world traffic datasets verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2019</p></details> |

Inspired by recent advances in vision-language foundation models, we investigate their utility for WSTVG, leveraging their zero-shot grounding capabilities. However, we find that a simple adaptation lacks essential spatio-temporal grounding abilities. To bridge this gap, we introduce Tubelet Referral Grounding (TRG), which connects textual queries to tubelets to enable spatio-temporal predictions. Despite its promise, TRG struggles with compositional action understanding and dense scene scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose STPro, a novel progressive learning framework with two key modules: (1) Sub-Action Temporal Curriculum Learning (SA-TCL), which incrementally builds compositional action understanding, and (2) Congestion-Guided Spatial Curriculum Learning (CG-SCL), which adapts the model to complex scenes by spatially increasing task difficulty. STPro achieves state-of-the-art results on three benchmark datasets, with improvements of 1.0% on VidSTG-Declarative and 3.0% on HCSTVG-v1.</p></details> | CVPR'25 Conference |

Although multi-view spatial images and temporal sequences of image-report pairs are available in off-the-shelf multi-modal medical datasets, most existing methods have not thoroughly tapped into such extensive supervision signals. In this paper, we introduce the Med-ST framework for fine-grained spatial and temporal modeling to exploit information from multiple spatial views of chest radiographs and temporal historical records. For spatial modeling, Med-ST employs the Mixture of View Expert (MoVE) architecture to integrate different visual features from both frontal and lateral views. To achieve a more comprehensive alignment, Med-ST not only establishes the global alignment between whole images and texts but also introduces modality-weighted local alignment between text tokens and spatial regions of images. For temporal modeling, we propose a novel cross-modal bidirectional cycle consistency objective by forward mapping classification (FMC) and reverse mapping regression (RMR). By perceiving temporal information from simple to complex, Med-ST can learn temporal semantics. Experimental results across four distinct tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of Med-ST, especially in temporal classification tasks. Our code and model are available at https://github.com/SVT-Yang/MedST.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICML 2024</p></details> |

Hypergraphs can establish prior unnatural dependencies for the skeleton. However, the existing methods only focus on the construction of spatial topology and ignore the time-point dependence. This paper proposes a dynamic spatial-temporal hypergraph convolutional network (DST-HCN) to capture spatial-temporal information for skeleton-based action recognition. DST-HCN introduces a time-point hypergraph (TPH) to learn relationships at time points. With multiple spatial static hypergraphs and dynamic TPH, our network can learn more complete spatial-temporal features. In addition, we use the high-order information fusion module (HIF) to fuse spatial-temporal information synchronously. Extensive experiments on NTU RGB+D, NTU RGB+D 120, and NW-UCLA datasets show that our model achieves state-of-the-art, especially compared with hypergraph methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Structure Learning for Spatial-Temporal Imputation: Adapting to Node and Feature Scales](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.18535v2)** | 2025-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial-temporal data collected across different geographic locations often suffer from missing values, posing challenges to data analysis. Existing methods primarily leverage fixed spatial graphs to impute missing values, which implicitly assume that the spatial relationship is roughly the same for all features across different locations. However, they may overlook the different spatial relationships of diverse features recorded by sensors in different locations. To address this, we introduce the multi-scale Graph Structure Learning framework for spatial-temporal Imputation (GSLI) that dynamically adapts to the heterogeneous spatial correlations. Our framework encompasses node-scale graph structure learning to cater to the distinct global spatial correlations of different features, and feature-scale graph structure learning to unveil common spatial correlation across features within all stations. Integrated with prominence modeling, our framework emphasizes nodes and features with greater significance in the imputation process. Furthermore, GSLI incorporates cross-feature and cross-temporal representation learning to capture spatial-temporal dependencies.
